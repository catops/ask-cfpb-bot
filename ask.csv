However, you should consider the following: You may need to enroll in a program with a fee or purchase a product to get this “free” credit score. That means it is not really free.

If you're over 21 years old with a spouse or partner, a credit card issuer can choose to look at your ability to pay either as an individual or as a couple.","It depends on whether a credit card issuer looks at whether you can pay for the card on your own. Before giving you a credit card, credit card companies have to make sure you have the ability to make your payments. If you are at least 21 years old and have a spouse or partner, a credit card issuer can choose to look at your ability to pay in two ways:As an individual, where they look only at your personal assets or income; orAs part of a couple, where they look at you and your spouse’s or partner’s combined assets or income. Example: Let’s say you’re a married, stay-at-home parent who is at least 21 years old, and you apply for a credit card with Company A. Company A turns you down and says its decision is based on your lack of income. Next, you apply for a credit card with Company B and they accept your application. This could be because Company A looked only at your personal, individual income, while Company B looked at your combined income with your spouse. Warning:  If you’re under 21, credit card companies have to look only at your individual income even if you have a spouse or partner 21 or older. In this case your individual income and/or assets could include: Income you earn yourself (such as your salary); Income or assets you earned from a company or property that you own independently or jointly with someone else; and/or Income or assets someone else regularly deposits into an account on which you are an accountholder (like an individual deposit account or a joint account). Note:  You can still have someone 21 or older, including your spouse or partner, co-sign with you on a credit card. When you do this, credit card companies will look at both yours and your co-signer’s assets or income.No matter how a credit card company looks at your ability to pay, they must do so in a way that is fair and does not discriminate against you.

31,What do I do if I think I have been a victim of identity theft?,"If you think you've been a victim of fraud or identity theft, contact one of the nationwide credit reporting companies and place a fraud alert in your credit report.","You can contact the three nationwide credit reporting companies here: Equifax: Online at https://www.alerts.equifax.com/AutoFraud_Online/jsp/fraudAlert.jsp By calling: (888) 766-0008By mail to:  Equifax Consumer Fraud Division, PO Box 740256, Atlanta, GA 30374 Experian:               Online at https://www.experian.com/fraud/center.html By calling: (888) 397-3742By mail to: Experian, P.O.

Box 2000, Chester, PA 19016A fraud alert requires creditors who check your credit report to take steps to verify your identity before opening a new account, issuing an additional card, or increasing the credit limit on an existing account based on a consumer’s request. When you place a fraud alert on your credit report at one of the nationwide credit reporting companies, it must notify the others. There are two main types of fraud alerts: initial fraud alerts and extended alerts. Initial fraud alertsYou can place an initial fraud alert on your credit report if you believe you are (or are about to become), a victim of fraud or identity theft. Credit reporting companies will keep that alert on your file for 90 days. After 90 days the initial fraud alert will expire and be removed, you have the option to place another initial fraud alert at that time.  An initial fraud alert requires that the creditor take reasonable steps to make sure the person making a new credit request in your name is actually you. If you provide a telephone number, the lender must call you or take reasonable steps to verify whether you are the person making the credit request.When you place an initial fraud alert in your file, you’re entitled to order one free copy of your credit report from each of the nationwide credit reporting companies. These free reports do not count as your free annual report from each credit reporting company. Extended alerts You can place an extended alert on your credit report after your identity has been stolen and you file an identity theft report.When you place an extended fraud alert in your file, you’re entitled to order two free copies of your credit report from each nationwide credit reporting company over a 12 month period. An extended alert is good for seven years. An extended alert requires that the creditor contact you in person or through the telephone number or other contact method you designate to verify whether you are the person making the credit request. Security freezesYou can also place a ""security freeze"" on your credit report, which prevents new creditors from accessing your credit file and others from opening accounts in your name, until you lift the freeze.Unlike fraud alerts, if you place a security freeze with one credit reporting company they will not notify the other credit reporting companies. You must contact each credit reporting company individually if you would like to place a security freeze with all three nationwide credit reporting companies. Because most businesses will not open credit accounts without checking your credit report, a freeze can stop identity thieves from opening new accounts in your name. Be mindful that a freeze doesn’t prevent identity thieves from taking over existing accounts. States have their own rules about credit freezes and how much you pay for them. Special help for servicemembersMembers of the military (such as members of the Marines, Army, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard) have an additional option available to them – active duty alerts, which give service members protection while they are on active duty. Active duty alerts last for 12 months.When you place an active duty alert on your credit report, creditors must take reasonable steps to make sure the person making the request is actually you before opening an account, issuing an additional credit card on an existing account, or increasing the credit limit on your existing account. Your name also will be removed for two years from the nationwide credit reporting companies’ pre-screen marketing lists for credit offers and insurance. Tip:To file an identity theft report, you must file either a police report or a report with a government agency such as the Federal Trade Commission.",/askcfpb/31/what-do-i-do-if-i-think-i-have-been-a-victim-of-identity-theft.html,APPROVED,Credit reports and scores,Fraud or identity theft | Credit card billing problems | Identity theft and card use without permission,,"<Question: 5 How do I get a copy of my credit reports?> | <Question: 1243 What is identity theft?> | <Question: 1369 What is identity monitoring or ""identity theft protection"" service?>",Credit Reporting Complaint

40,I bought something using my store credit card and was told that interest would be deferred and that I would not have to pay any interest for 12 months. How does that work?,"If you were told that you do not have to pay interest on the purchase if the purchase is paid in full within 12 months, your card has a deferred interest plan.  It’s important to understand how deferred interest works.  Otherwise, you could end up having to pay the interest you thought you were deferring.","How interest is calculated: A deferred interest plan means that you won’t have to pay any interest on the purchase if you pay it off within the specified time frame – in this case, 12 months. However, if you haven’t paid off the balance or if you are more than 60 days late in making a minimum payment before the deferred interest period ends, you will be charged interest on that balance. Usually, the interest is calculated based on the balance you owed in each month since you first made the purchase. In this case, if you don’t pay the entire balance off in 12 months, or if you are more than 60 days late in making a minimum payment, you will be charged interest for each month on the balance you owed in each of the 12 months. Here’s what you generally need to know about deferred interest plans:You need to pay off the full balance by the end of the deferred interest period, or else you could have to pay all of the interest that you expected to be deferred. That means you would owe all of the interest back to the original date of the charge. You still need to make at least your minimum payments when they are due. If you’re more than 60 days late making your payments, you could lose the deferred interest period. Note that a single late payment could have other consequences, like late fees. Your minimum payments probably won’t be enough to pay off the entire balance by the end of the deferred interest period.If you have other balances on the card that have a higher APR than the deferred interest balance, any amount above your minimum payment will be automatically applied to the balance with the higher APR. This changes in the last two billing cycles in your deferred interest period, when any amount above your minimum payment will be applied to the deferred interest purchases.If you use the card for other purchases, you might lose your grace period on those purchases if you don’t pay off the entire card balance – including the deferred interest portion – at the next payment due date. Five tips for paying off your deferred interest purchase: Know when your deferred interest period ends. The front page of your bill shows when the deferred interest period ends. Your deferred interest period might have a different end date than your regular monthly payment due date.Pay more than the minimum each month.  Your minimum payment alone usually won’t pay off your deferred interest purchase before the deferred interest period ends. Calculate how much you’ll have to pay each month to pay off the purchase on time (or early, if possible). Consider doing this before you make the purchase so you know whether you’ll be able to pay it off in time.Ask your card company to apply anything you pay above the minimum monthly payment amount to your deferred interest balance. Your credit card company may not honor this request, but if it does, it may increase your likelihood of paying the balance in full before the end of the deferred interest period. This payment schedule changes when there are only two months left in your deferred interest period. At that point, if you pay any more than the minimum monthly payment, your card issuer must use that money to pay down your deferred interest purchases. Make your payments on time. It’s important to make your payments on time. Late payments can mean you owe all of the interest that would have been deferred.Try to pay off your deferred interest balance well before the deferred interest period ends. That way, you avoid having your payment take too long to arrive or forgetting to make that last payment. If you don’t, you will be charged interest on your purchase going back to the date you first made that purchase. TIP:If you accept a deferred interest plan, you have to keep track of how you are paying off that original charge, or you could end up owing the interest after all.",/askcfpb/40/I-got-a-credit-card-promising-no-interest-for-a-purchase-if-I-pay-in-full-within-12-months-How-does-this-work.html,APPROVED,Credit cards,Interest rates | Understanding a credit card bill | Other credit card questions,,<Question: 39 My bill shows different APRs and shows how much of the balance is subject to each interest rate.

This does not mean that the interest rate will never change, but the issuer generally must notify you before the change occurs, and in most circumstances can apply the higher rate only to purchases and other transactions you make after you get the notice.A variable-rate APR or variable APR changes with the index interest rate, such as the prime rate published in the Wall Street Journal.

47,What is a grace period? How does it work?,"As ""grace period"" is the period between the end of a billing cycle and the date your payment is due. With most credit cards, you can avoid paying interest on purchases if you pay your balance in full by the due date each month.","Card issuers that provide a grace period must establish procedures to assure that bills are mailed or delivered at least 21 days before they are due.If you do not pay your balance in full, you will generally be charged interest on the unpaid portion of the balance, and interest will be charged on purchases in the new billing cycle starting on the date each purchase is made.With credit cards, grace periods typically apply only to purchase transactions. If you use your card to get a cash advance or use a check you received from your card issuer, generally you will start paying interest as of the date of the transaction. Most card issuers also charge a different interest rate if you use your credit card to get cash or to write a check. Your statement generally must show the APR that applies to cash and cash-like transactions and the amount of the balance that falls in that category.  There may be more than one such APR, for example, one that applies to cash advances and a different APR for checks.Your cardholder agreement must include the rules your card issuer applies to determine which transactions fall into which categories and must list the different interest rates.

Remember, the address where you should send this notice is usually different from the payment address. Make sure your letter includes: Your name and account number The dollar amount of the charge you are disputing An explanation of the reason why you think an error was madeOnce your credit card company receives your letter, it has 30 days to confirm it received it.

You don’t have to pay the disputed amount while the card issuer is investigating. You can’t be required to pay interest or other charges relating to the disputed amount during the investigation. If you pay the entire undisputed amount of your bill on time, the card issuer can’t treat your payment as late. Note:If you already paid the charge that you’re disputing, you can still dispute it. But you probably won’t get the payment back until the credit card company has investigated your dispute and decided that you were right.If the card issuer finds you are correct, the charge should be removed from your bill.

70,I received a notice saying the card issuer was going to change the terms of my account. Can they do that?  What can I do?,,"The card issuer has the right to change the terms of the agreement. For “significant changes,” the card issuer must give you 45 days advance notice. Significant changes generally involve the interest rate, fees, grace period, minimum amount due, and the method for calculating interest charges. Significant changes generally do not include changes to the benefits you get from your credit card, such as points or cash rewards, or changes in the brand (for example, changing from Visa to MasterCard or vice versa).There are certain restrictions about what changes the card issuer can make. For example, card issuers generally cannot increase the interest rate you pay on existing balances. There are also rules about the maximum amount the issuer can charge for a late or overlimit fee and the minimum amount of time you must be given before your payment is due. But if the card issuer does not violate any of these rules, it can make changes to your agreement.For many changes, you have the right to opt out. However, if you opt out, the card issuer may close your account. If so, you do not have to pay the balance in full immediately after the account is closed, but you will still be responsible for making payments until the balance is paid in full.

If your rate is higher than what you would be charged as a new customer, the card issuer must reduce your rate to the rate charged for new customers. However, this rate will not necessarily be as low as your original rate. If your rate increased because of factors specific to you (such as because you made a late payment), then instead of comparing your rate to the interest rate charged new customers, the card issuer may consider whether the factors that led the card issuer to increase your interest rate still apply.

99,What is a mortgage?,,"A mortgage is an agreement between you and a lender that gives the lender the right to take your property if you fail to repay the money you’ve borrowed plus interest. Mortgage loans are used to buy a home or to borrow money against the value of a home you already own. TIP: Seven things to look for in a mortgage: The size of the loan The interest rate and any associated pointsThe closing costs of the loan, including the lender’s fees The Annual Percentage Rate (APR) The type of interest rate and whether it can change (is it fixed or adjustable?)The loan term, or how long you have to repay the loanWhether the loan has other risky features, such as a pre-payment penalty, a balloon clause, an interest-only feature, or negative amortization TIP: Focus on a mortgage that is affordable for you given your other priorities, not on how much you qualify for. Lenders will tell you how much you are qualified to borrow – that is, how much they are willing to lend you. Several online calculators will compare your income and debts and come up with similar answers. But how much you could borrow is very different from how much you can afford to repaywithout stretching your budget for other important items too thin. Lenders do not take into account all your family and financial circumstances. To know how much you can afford to repay, you’ll need to take a hard look at your family’s income, expenses and savings priorities to see what fits comfortably within your budget. TIP: Don’t forget other costs when coming up with your ideal payment. Costs such as homeowner’s insurance, property taxes, and private mortgage insurance are typically added to your monthly mortgage payment, so be sure to include these costs when calculating how much you can afford. You can get estimates from your local tax assessor, insurance agent and lender.

100,What is the difference between a fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) loan? ,"The difference between a fixed rate and an adjustable rate mortgage, is that for fixed rates the interest rate is set when you take out the loan and will not change. With an adjustable rate mortgage, the interest rate may go up or down.","With a fixed rate mortgage, the interest rate is set when you take out the loan and will not change. With an adjustable rate mortgage (ARM), the interest rate may go up or down. Many ARMs will start at a lower interest rate than fixed rate mortgages. This initial rate may stay the same for months or years. When this introductory period is over, your interest rate will change and the amount of your payment will likely go up. Part of the interest rate you pay will be tied to a broader measure of interest rates, called an index. Your payment goes up when this index of interest rates moves higher. When interest rates decline, sometimes your payment may go down, but that is not true for all ARMs. Many ARMs will limit the amount of each adjustment, and set a maximum or “cap” on how high your interest rate can go over the life of the loan. Some ARMs also limit how low your interest rate can go. Tip: Know how your ARM adjusts. Before taking out an adjustable rate mortgage, find out: How high your interest rate and monthly payments can go with each adjustment  How frequently your interest rate will adjust How soon your payment could go up If there is a cap on how high your interest rate could go If there is a limit on how low your interest rate could go If you will still be able to afford the loan if the rate and payment go up to the maximums allowed under the loan contract Tip: Don't assume you’ll be able to sell your home or refinance your loan before the rate changes. The value of your property could decline or your financial condition could change. If you can’t afford the higher payments on today’s income, you may want to consider another loan.

102,What is an option or payment-option ARM?,,"An option or payment-option ARM is an adjustable rate mortgage with several possible payment choices. Some of the payment choices do not cover the full amount needed to pay down the loan. The payment “options” usually include:  Paying an amount that covers both your principal and interest. This is the only way you can reduce the amount you owe on your mortgage loan with each payment. Paying an amount that covers only your interest. Interest-only payments do not pay down your principal, or the amount you borrowed.  Paying a minimum (or limited) amount that does not even cover the interest. The interest you do not pay will be added to your principal loan balance. This increases the amount of debt you owe. Tip: If you have an option ARM or a payment-option ARM, always try to pay all of the interest and some of the principal when making your mortgage payment. Your mortgage payment includes at least two parts – principal and interest. Principal is what you borrowed from the lender. Interest is what the lender charges you for the use of the money you borrowed. Your payment may also include the cost of taxes and insurance if you have an escrow account. If you don’t repay the principal, you are not making any progress in paying back the debt. If you are not paying all the interest, it will get added to what you owe.   If you have a payment-option ARM and you’re regularly skipping your principal or full interest payments to make ends meet, you may be heading for trouble.  TIP:  Try to avoid paying interest on interest. Certain loans have payment options that let you pay only a portion of the amount of interest you owe each month. If you only pay some of the interest, the amount that you do not pay may get added to your principal balance. Then you end up paying not only interest on the money you borrowed, but interest on the interest you are being charged for the money you borrowed. This dramatically increases the amount of debt you have and the cost of the loan.

103,What is negative amortization?,,"Amortization means paying off a loan with regular payments. Negative amortization means that even when you pay your minimum payment, because you are not paying the interest, the amount you owe will still go up.

This can mean your payments are lower in the years before the balloon payment comes due but you will owe a big amount at the end of the loan.,"Generally, a balloon payment is more than two times the loan’s average monthly payment, and often it can be tens of thousands of dollars. Most balloon loans require one large payment that pays off your remaining balance at the end of the loan. If you’re considering a balloon loan, you need to think about whether and how you can make the balloon payment when it comes due.A balloon payment isn’t allowed in a type of loan called a Qualified Mortgage, with some limited exceptions. Tip:  Don't assume you’ll sell your home or refinance your loan before you have to make a balloon payment.If the value of your property falls, or if your financial condition declines, you might not be able to sell or refinance in time.

105,"What is a second mortgage loan or ""junior-lien""? ",,"A second mortgage or junior-lien is a loan you take out using your house as collateral while you still have another loan secured by your house. Home equity loans and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) are common examples of second mortgages. Some second mortgages are “open-end” (meaning you can continue to take cash out up to the maximum credit amount and, as you pay down the balance, can draw again up to the same limit) and other second mortgage loans are “closed-end” (in which you receive the entire loan amount upfront and cannot redraw after that). The term “second” means that if you can no longer pay your mortgages and your home is sold to pay off the debts, this loan is paid off second. If there is not enough equity to pay off both loans completely, your second mortgage loan lender may not get the full amount it is owed. As a result, second mortgage loans often carry higher interest rates than first mortgage loans.  By taking out a second mortgage, you are adding to your overall debt burden. Anytime you add on to your overall debt burden, you make yourself more vulnerable in case you then experience financial difficulties that affect your ability to repay your debts. It is important to know that a major risk with home equity loans or home equity lines of credit is that if you cannot repay a home equity loan or home equity line of credit, you could potentially lose your home because you are using the equity in your home as collateral.  Tip: Be careful using home equity to consolidate higher interest debts. When you use home equity to pay off other debts you really aren’t paying them off. You are merely taking out one loan to repay another. The interest rates may be lower in the short term, but that’s only because you are using your home as collateral. The risk is that if you can’t repay your home equity loan, you could lose your home. Plus, if you take on more debt, that could make repaying that new debt and existing loans difficult. For example, taking out a mortgage to pay off a five year car loan may have you making payments and paying additional interest for ten, fifteen, or even thirty years. Be careful about trading short-term debt for long-term debt at a higher cost to you.",/askcfpb/105/what-is-a-second-mortgage-loan-or-junior-lien.html,APPROVED,Mortgages,Trouble paying a mortgage | Definitions,,<Question: 106 What is a home equity loan?> | <Question: 107 My lender offered me a home equity line of credit (HELOC).

106,What is a home equity loan?,,"A home equity loan (sometimes called a HEL) allows you to borrow money using the equity in your home as collateral. Equity is the amount your property is currently worth, minus the amount of any other mortgage on your property. You receive the money from a home equity loan as a lump sum and usually have a fixed interest rate that will not change. If you cannot pay back the HEL, the lender could foreclose on your home. If you are considering taking out a HEL to pay off your debts, you should explore alternatives with a credit counselor that do not potentially put your home at the risk of a forced sale. Moreover, home equity loans may have upfront fees and costs, so be sure to compare more than just your monthly payment when shopping around.  TIP: Talk to a credit counselor before consolidating your debts with a home equity loan. Before taking out a home equity loan to consolidate your debts, talk to a qualified credit counselor to help you weigh your options. Look for a non-profit credit counseling organization that can: Advise you on managing your money and debts Help you develop a budget Give you free educational materials or workshops Avoid firms that ask for big fees up-front or that make unrealistic promises – like restoring your credit or repaying your debts for pennies on the dollar.  Start your search at the National Foundation for Credit Counseling’s website or by calling 800-388-2227. Once you’ve identified counselors near you, check with your local Better Business Bureau or state attorney general’s office to see if any of them has a history of complaints. TIP: Be careful about borrowing against your home as part of an investment strategy. There is no such thing as a “risk-free” or “guaranteed” investment. You should carefully consider all your options before you borrow against your home to invest. All investments can lose value and that could put your home at risk if you cannot repay the loan later on.",/askcfpb/106/what-is-a-home-equity-loan.html,APPROVED,Mortgages,Home equity loans | Definitions,,<Question: 118 How can I figure out if I can afford to buy a home and take out a mortgage?> | <Question: 119 What are some of the financial considerations when thinking about buying or renting a home?> | <Question: 247 What is the difference between a Home Equity Loan and a Home Equity Line of Credit?>,Owning a Home
107,My lender offered me a home equity line of credit (HELOC). What is a HELOC?,,"A home equity line of credit (HELOC) is an “open-end” line of credit that allows you to borrow repeatedly against your home equity. You “draw” on the line over time, usually up to some credit limit, using special checks or a credit card. As you repay the principal, you can draw that amount again. This part of the plan is known as the “draw period,” which usually lasts for some fixed term, such as ten years. After the draw period ends, you typically then enter the “repayment period,” during which you must pay off the outstanding balance in regular periodic payments of principal and interest. The repayment period is also a fixed term of years.Depending upon your lender and your HELOC agreement, you may have to pay back the whole amount you borrowed as soon as the repayment period begins. HELOCs usually have a variable interest rate that changes over time, so your payments may not be the same from month to month. If the value of your home decreases significantly, your lender may decide not to allow you to take out additional credit under your HELOC plan, which may result in you not having access to as much money as you thought you would. The lender may also freeze your ability to take out additional funds if your financial circumstances change and your lender does not believe you will be able to make your payments. Tip: If you are considering a home equity line of credit, shop around to compare all your options. Just like other mortgages, HELOCs have costs and fees associated with them. Also, be sure you review the risks of this type of credit. If you do not understand the terms and conditions for your loan, ask your lender, broker, trusted financial advisor or housing counselor. The best way to avoid problems is not to sign anything you don’t understand. Tip:If you are having trouble with your bills, taking out a HELOC to pay down your debt may cause more trouble for you and put your home at risk. Before taking out a HELOC to consolidate your debts, talk to a U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development-approved housing counselor. A HUD-approved housing counselorcan: Advise you on managing your money and debts Help you develop a budget Give you free educational materials or workshops Avoid firms that ask for big fees up-front or that make unrealistic promises – like restoring your credit or repaying your debts for pennies on the dollar.

Several online calculators will compare your income and debts and come up with similar answers based on standard ratios. But how much you could borrow is very different from how much you can afford to repay without stretching your budget for other important items too thin. Lenders do not take into account all your family and financial circumstances. To know how much you can afford to repay, you’ll need to take a hard look at your family’s income, expenses and savings priorities to see what fits comfortably within your budget. Also, remember that your monthly payment could change in the future, depending on what type of mortgage loan you have. Consider how future, higher mortgage payments will fit in with your budget.   Tip: Don’t forget other mortgage- and home-related costs when determining your ideal payment. Homeowner’s insurance, property taxes, and possibly private mortgage insurance or homeowners association fees are typically added to your monthly mortgage payment, so be sure to include these costs when calculating how much you can afford. There may also be costs for repairs and maintenance of your home. You can get estimates from your insurance agent, local tax assessor, homeowners association, and lender. Knowing how much you can comfortably pay each month will also help you estimate a reasonable price range for your new home.    Tip: Don’t sacrifice savings in order to buy a bigger house. When reviewing your budget to determine an affordable mortgage payment, don’t forget about your savings. You likely will still need to save for emergencies, retirement, college for the children, and other priorities even after you’re a homeowner. Consider adding more money to your emergency fund or household fund to avoid going into debt to pay for sudden repairs, expensive replacements, or other necessities.    Tip: Learn how new mortgage rules may help you when you shop for a mortgage.",/askcfpb/118/how-can-i-figure-out-if-i-can-afford-to-buy-a-home-and-take-out-a-mortgage.html,APPROVED,Mortgages,Applying for a mortgage,,<Question: 100 What is the difference between a fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) loan? > | <Question: 122 What is private mortgage insurance?

119,What are some of the financial considerations when thinking about buying or renting a home?,,"Buying a home and taking out a mortgage might make sense if: You have a steady source of income and a good record of paying your bills on time. Lenders will look at your ability to repay the mortgage and how positive your credit history is when deciding if you qualify for a loan.Home prices where you are looking to buy are stable. One risk of buying a home is that its value could go down. If that happens, you could even end up owing more on your home loan than the property is worth. You are able to pay for property taxes, homeowner’s insurance, water, and other utilities which might cost more than utilities you might pay for when you're renting.You’re willing to stay put for a few years. Buying and selling a home are expensive processes involving lots of fees and commissions. You’ll want to stay in the home long enough to make these costs worth it. Also, if home prices aren’t stable or are declining, you might find that you can't move after just a few years because you may owe more than the house is then worth.You can cover the cost of repairs and maintenance. When you own the home, you’re responsible for maintenance and repairs – from small ones like a leaky faucet to major ones like replacing a roof. Be sure to build an emergency fund to cover unexpected expenses. The potential tax advantages make sense given your financial situation. Consult your financial or tax advisor to determine whether there are tax advantages to buying instead of renting.

120,What kind of down payment do I need? How does the amount of down payment I make affect the terms of my mortgage loan?,,"There are many options for making down payments. The amount of your down payment will vary by the loan you choose and the lender’s requirements. Generally, the larger the down payment you are able to make, the lower the interest rate you will receive and the more likely you are to be approved. If you cannot make a down payment of 20 percent, lenders usually will require you to purchase private mortgage insurance or obtain an FHA, VA, or USDA loan.  TIP:  Ask about how your down payment affects your interest rate and what options you have when you shop around for different loans. TIP: Don’t forget to factor in all the upfront costs you will have in addition to the down payment. Think about all the costs that you’ll likely have to deal with during the purchase process and immediately afterward. For example, you may want to pay points to lower your interest rate. You’ll also have to pay closing costs, which sometimes can be substantial.

The higher your down payment, the lower your loan-to-value ratio. Some lenders require borrowers to get private mortgage insurance where the loan amount is too close to the value of the home.

122,What is private mortgage insurance? How does PMI work?,"Private mortgage insurance, also called PMI, is a type of mortgage insurance you might be required to pay for if you have a conventional loan. Like other kinds of mortgage insurance, PMI protects the lender—not you—if you stop making payments on your loan.","PMI is arranged by the lender and provided by private insurance companies. PMI is usually required when you have a conventional loan and make a down payment of less than 20 percent of the home’s purchase price. If you’re refinancing with a conventional loan and your equity is less than 20 percent of the value of your home, PMI is also usually required. How do I pay for PMI?There are several different ways to pay for PMI. Some lenders may offer more than one option, while other lenders do not. Before agreeing to a mortgage, ask lenders what choices they offer. The most common way to pay for PMI is a monthly premium. This premium is added to your mortgage payment. The premium is shown on your Loan Estimate and Closing Disclosure on page 1, in the Projected Payments section. You will get a Loan Estimate when you apply for a mortgage, before you agree to this mortgage. The premium is also shown on your Closing Disclosure on page 1, in the Projected Payments section. Sometimes you pay for PMI with a one-time upfront premium paid at closing. This premium is shown on your Loan Estimate and Closing Disclosure on page 2, in section B.If you make an upfront payment and then move or refinance, you may not be entitled to a refund of the premium. Sometimes you pay with both upfront and monthly premiums. The upfront premium is shown on your Loan Estimate and Closing Disclosure on page 2, in section B. The premium added to your monthly mortgage payment is shown on your Loan Estimate and Closing Disclosure on page 1, in the Projected Payments section. Lenders might offer you more than one option. Ask the loan officer to help you calculate the total costs over a few different timeframes that are realistic for you. What factors should I consider when deciding whether to choose a loan that requires PMI?Like other kinds of mortgage insurance, PMI can help you qualify for a loan that you might not otherwise be able to get. But, it may increase the cost of your loan. And it doesn’t protect you if you run into problems on your mortgage – it only protects the lender.Lenders sometimes offer conventional loans with smaller down payments that do not require PMI. Usually, you will pay a higher interest rate for these loans. Paying a higher interest rate can be more or less expensive than PMI - it depends on a number of factors, including how long you plan to stay in the home. You may also want to ask a tax advisor about whether paying more in interest or paying PMI might affect your taxes differently.Borrowers making a low down payment may also want to consider other types of loans, such as an FHA loan. Other types of loans may be more or less expensive than a conventional loan with PMI, depending on your credit score, your down payment amount, the particular lender, and general market conditions. You may also want to consider saving up the money to make a 20 percent down payment. When you pay 20 percent down, PMI is not required with a conventional loan. You may also receive a lower interest rate with a 20 percent down payment. Ask lenders to show you detailed pricing for different options so you can see which option is the best deal. TIP: You may be able to cancel your monthly mortgage insurance premium once you’ve accumulated a certain amount of equity in your home. Learn more about your rights and ask lenders about their cancellation policies. Warning:Private mortgage insurance protects the lender – not you. If you fall behind on your payments, PMI will not protect you and you can lose your home through foreclosure.",/askcfpb/122/what-is-private-mortgage-insurance.html,APPROVED,Mortgages,Applying for a mortgage | Definitions,,<Question: 112 What is an FHA loan?> | <Question: 117 What is a conventional loan?> | <Question: 202 When can I remove private mortgage insurance (PMI) from my loan?>,Owning a Home
123,Where can I get money for a down payment on a home mortgage?,,"It depends on your situation. If you don't have cash for a down payment, there are several options available:  Put off buying the home and start saving until you have enough money for a down payment. Get help from parents or other people you trust. Gifts can be used as down payments, as long as you can present a signed statement saying the money is a gift and not a third-party loan and can prove the source of money.  You may be able to withdraw up to $10,000 from a traditional, SIMPLE, or Roth individual retirement account (IRA) without penalty. Generally, if you're under 59 and a half years old, you would have to pay a 10 percent tax penalty on early withdrawals. However, if the money is used to buy, build, or rebuild a first home, the penalty may be waived. Warning: Think twice before using retirement savings on your down payment. The biggest benefit of saving in an IRA is the tax-free growth of investment earnings. If you remove the principal to fund your down payment, you’ll have less money in the retirement account to grow tax-free. Your savings will not grow as quickly.    Tip:  Roth IRAs work differently than other IRAs. Consult a trusted tax or financial advisor before making any withdrawal to see if this makes the most financial sense for you.In some cases, you can borrow money to make a down payment. However, you should carefully consider that option since borrowing your down payment would increase your overall debt and your monthly payments.Sometimes local non-profit or government organizations can offer you a second mortgage on special terms to replace a down payment.

While there are some legal distinctions, in practice both terms refer to a letter from a lender that says the lender is generally willing to lend to you, up to a certain amount and based on certain assumptions. This letter helps you to make an offer on a home, because it gives the seller confidence that you will be able to get financing to buy their home. It is not a guaranteed loan offer.Don’t worry about which word lenders use. Some lenders may use the word “prequalification,” while other lenders may call the letter a “preapproval.” In reality, lenders’ processes vary widely, and the words they use don’t tell you much about a particular lender’s process. The important thing is that the letter you receive provides enough information for sellers in your area to take it seriously. The best way to make sure that the letter you have will serve its purpose is to ask a local real estate agent.Lenders usually check your credit when issuing a prequalification or preapproval letter. Many people wait to get a preapproval letter until they are ready to begin shopping seriously for a home.

135,What is the difference between a mortgage interest rate and an APR?,The difference between a mortgage interest rate and an annual percentage rate is that a mortgage interest rate is the cost you pay each year to borrow money for a mortgage. An annual percentage rate reflects the mortgage interest rate and other charges.,"There are many costs associated with taking out a mortgage. These include: The interest rate Points Fees Other chargesThe interest rate is the cost you will pay each year to borrow the money, expressed as a percentage rate. It does not reflect fees or any other charges you may have to pay for the loan.An annual percentage rate (APR) is a broader measure of the cost to you of borrowing money. The APR reflects not only the interest rate but also the points, mortgage broker fees, and other charges that you have to pay to get the loan. For that reason, your APR is usually higher than your interest rate. Tip Take care when comparing the APRs of adjustable-rate loans. For adjustable rate loans, the APR does not reflect the maximum interest rate of the loan. Be careful when comparing the APRs of fixed-rate loans with adjustable-rate loans, or among different adjustable-rate loans. Don’t look at the APR alone in determining what loan makes the most sense for your circumstances. TipIf you're shopping for a mortgage, learn how new mortgage rules may help you shop.

136,What are discount points or points?,,"Generally, points and lender credits let you make tradeoffs in how you pay for your mortgage and closing costs.Points, also known as discount points, lower your interest rate in exchange for an upfront fee.  Lender credits lower your closing costs in exchange for a higher interest rate.These terms can sometimes be used to mean other things. “Points” is a term that mortgage lenders have used for many years. Some lenders may use the word “points” to refer to any upfront fee that is calculated as a percentage of your loan amount, whether or not you receive a lower interest rate. Some lenders may also offer lender credits that are unconnected to the interest rate you pay – for example, a temporary offer, or to compensate for a problem.The information below refers to points and lender credits that are connected to your interest rate. If you’re considering paying points or receiving lender credits, always ask lenders to clarify what the impact on your interest rate will be.PointsPoints let you make a tradeoff between your upfront costs and your monthly payment. By paying points, you pay more upfront, but you receive a lower interest rate and therefore pay less over time. Points can be a good choice for someone who knows they will keep the loan for a long time.Points are calculated in relation to the loan amount. Each point equals one percent of the loan amount. For example, one point on a $100,000 loan would be one percent of the loan amount, or $1,000. Two points would be two percent of the loan amount, or $2,000. Points don’t have to be round numbers – you can pay 1.375 points ($1,375), 0.5 points ($500) or even 0.125 points ($125). The points are paid at closing and increase your closing costs.Paying points lowers your interest rate relative to the interest rate you could get with a zero-point loan at the same lender. A loan with one point should have a lower interest rate than a loan with zero points, assuming both loans are offered by the same lender and are the same kind of loan. For example, the loans are both fixed-rate or both adjustable-rate, and they both have the same loan term, loan type, same down payment amount, etc. The same kind of loan with the same lender with two points should have an even lower interest rate than a loan with one point. Points are listed on your Loan Estimate and on your Closing Disclosure on page 2, Section A. By law, points listed on your Loan Estimate and on your Closing Disclosure must be connected to a discounted interest rate.The exact amount that your interest rate is reduced depends on the specific lender, the kind of loan, and the overall mortgage market. Sometimes you may receive a relatively large reduction in your interest rate for each point paid. Other times, the reduction in interest rate for each point paid may be smaller. It depends on the specific lender, the kind of loan, and market conditions.It’s also important to understand that a loan with one point at one lender may or may not have a lower interest rate than the same kind of loan with zero points at a different lender. Each lender has their own pricing structure, and some lenders may be more or less expensive overall than other lenders – regardless of whether you’re paying points or not. That’s why it pays to shop around for your mortgage. Explore current interest rates or learn more about how to shop for a mortgage.Lender creditsLender credits work the same way as points, but in reverse. You pay a higher interest rate and the lender gives you money to offset your closing costs. When you receive lender credits, you pay less upfront, but you pay more over time with the higher interest rate.Lender credits are calculated the same way as points, and may appear on lenders’ worksheets as negative points. For example, a lender credit of $1,000 on a $100,000 loan might be described as negative one point (because $1,000 is one percent of $100,000). That $1,000 will appear as a negative number as part of the Lender Credits line item on page 2, Section J of your Loan Estimate or Closing Disclosure. The lender credit offsets your closing costs and lowers the amount you have to pay at closing.In exchange for the lender credit, you will pay a higher interest rate than what you would have received with the same lender, for the same kind of loan, without lender credits. The more lender credits you receive, the higher your rate will be.The exact increase in your interest rate depends on the specific lender, the kind of loan, and the overall mortgage market. Sometimes, you may receive a relatively large lender credit for each 0.125% increase in your interest rate paid. Other times, the lender credit you receive per 0.125% increase in your interest rate may be smaller.A loan with a one-percent lender credit at one lender may or may not have a higher interest rate than the same kind of loan with no lender credits at a different lender. Each lender has their own pricing structure, and some lenders may be more or less expensive overall than other lenders – regardless of whether or not you’re receiving lender credits. Explore current interest rates or learn more about how to shop for a mortgage.See an exampleThe chart below shows an example of the tradeoffs you can make with points and credits. In the example, you borrow $180,000 and qualify for a 30-year fixed-rate loan at an interest rate of 5.0% with zero points. In the first column, you choose to pay points to reduce your rate. In third column, you choose to receive lender credits to reduce your closing costs. In the middle column, you do neither. TIP:Whether or not you should pay points or agree to a higher interest rate in exchange for a lender credit depends in part on how long you plan to keep the loan. If you are unsure, ask a loan officer to show you two different options (with and without points or credits) and to calculate the total costs over a few different possible timeframes. Choose the shortest amount of time, the longest amount of time, and the most likely amount of time you can see yourself keeping the loan. You can also review your options with a HUD-certified housing counselor.   TIP:When comparing offers from different lenders, ask for the same amount of points or credits from each lender.",/askcfpb/136/what-are-discount-points-and-lender-credits-and-how-do-they-work.html,APPROVED,Mortgages,Applying for a mortgage,,<Question: 118 How can I figure out if I can afford to buy a home and take out a mortgage?> | <Question: 119 What are some of the financial considerations when thinking about buying or renting a home?> | <Question: 135 What is the difference between a mortgage interest rate and an APR?>,Owning a Home
137,How do I find the best loan available when I&#146;m shopping for a home mortgage loan? ,,"Shopping around for a mortgage loan will help you get the best deal. The internet is a good place to start your search. By doing a broad online search for mortgage rates in your area, you will get a good sense of the market. You also need to pay attention to what points or fees will be charged for a mortgage. Sometimes you can get a better rate if you are willing to pay ""points"" or additional fees. Make sure that the extra points being paid actually result in you receiving a lower interest rate. Next, contact banks, credit unions, or other lenders and mortgage brokers in your area. Ask each lender or broker you call for a list of current interest rates for their available mortgage loans and whether the rates being quoted are the lowest for that day or week. Also find out what fees the lender normally charges for each loan product. You should ask whether the rates given for various products are fixed or adjustable, and what points or fees go along with different rates. You may also want to ask about each loan’s annual percentage rate (APR). The APR tells you the yearly cost of the loan based on the interest rate as well as points, broker fees and certain other charges that you may be required to pay, including certain closing costs. There are many different types of mortgage loans available, so be sure you understand all of your options. If you are a veteran or servicemember, you may qualify for a VA loan. If you have concerns about your credit history or only have enough to make a smaller down payment, you may qualify for an FHA loan. With all of the options out there, it is important to shop around and take the time to understand the terms of the different loans offered to you. Tip: Ask these questions to better understand your loan offer: Is the interest rate fixed or adjustable? Do I need to pay points? What fees will I have to pay? Will I pay those myself or will the lender loan the fees to me? What is the term of the loan? How much will my payment be and will it eventually pay off my principal?

140,What is an escrow or impound account? ,"An escrow account, sometimes called an impound account depending on where you live, is set up by your mortgage lender to pay certain property-related expenses on your behalf.","If your loan includes escrow, you will pay monthly installments for taxes and insurance along with your monthly mortgage payment. Your mortgage servicer will deposit these monthly installments into the escrow account. Then, your servicer uses the funds to pay your bills when they come due, typically once or twice per year.Many lenders require that you pay your taxes and insurance using escrow, so they can make sure that the bill gets paid. Your mortgage servicer will manage the escrow account and pay these bills on your behalf. Sometimes, escrow accounts may also be required by law.Your property taxes and insurance premiums can change from year to year. Your escrow payment – and with it, your total monthly payment will change accordingly. TIP:If your loan doesn’t include an escrow account, you will have to plan to pay these large expenses yourself. Be sure you budget for these extra costs and stay current on your taxes and insurance payments. If you fail to pay your property taxes, your state or local government may impose fines and penalties or place a tax lien on your home. You could also face foreclosure.In addition, if you fail to pay your taxes or insurance, your lender may: Add the amounts to your loan balance Add an escrow account to your loanPurchase new homeowners insurance for you and bill you for it. This lender-purchased insurance, known as force-placed insurance, is typically more expensive than homeowners insurance you pay on your own. TIP: Even if your lender does not require an escrow account, consider requesting one voluntarily. An escrow account makes it easier to budget for your large property-related bills by paying small amounts with each mortgage payment. That way you don’t have to scramble to pay a large property tax bill or insurance premium when it comes due.",/askcfpb/140/what-is-an-escrow-or-impound-account.html,SUBMITTED,Mortgages,Applying for a mortgage | Definitions,,<Question: 162 What is homeowner's insurance?> | <Question: 198 What&#146;s the difference between a mortgage lender and a servicer?> | <Question: 213 Why did my monthly mortgage payment go up?>,Owning a Home
141,Is there such a thing as a no-cost or no-closing loan or refinancing?  ,,"Yes, some lenders or mortgage brokers may offer you a loan that is advertised as having no lender fees or no closing costs. There are two ways lenders can do this. One way is by charging you a higher interest rate to cover the cost of making the loan. The other way is by adding the closing costs to your loan amount. Both methods involve no cash to close the loan but result in a higher monthly payment.",/askcfpb/141/is-there-such-a-thing-as-a-no-cost-or-no-closing-loan-or-refinancing.html,APPROVED,Mortgages,Understanding mortgages | Applying for a mortgage,,<Question: 130 What is the difference between a mortgage broker and a mortgage lender? > | <Question: 135 What is the difference between a mortgage interest rate and an APR?> | <Question: 139 What are closing costs?>,Owning a Home
143,What's a lock-in or a rate lock?,,"Mortgage interest rates can change daily, sometimes hourly. If your interest rate is locked, your rate won’t change between now and closing, as long as you close within the specified timeframe and there are no changes to your application. Rate locks are typically available for 30, 45, or 60 days, and sometimes longer.Some lenders may lock your rate as part of issuing a Loan Estimate, but some may not. Check at the top of page 1 of your Loan Estimate to see if your rate is locked, and until when.   The interest rate on your Loan Estimate is not a guarantee. If your rate is not locked, it can change at any time. If your rate is locked, it can still change if there are changes in your application—including your loan amount, credit score, or verified income.  Here are some common reasons why your interest rate might change, even though it is locked: You decided to change the kind of loan you are requesting or the amount of your down payment The appraisal on the home you want to buy came in higher or lower than expected.Your credit score changes, for example because you applied for or took out a new loan, or missed a payment on an existing loan or credit card.Your lender could not document your overtime, bonus or other income.Rate lock policies vary by lender.  Choosing whether to lock your rate can make an important difference in your monthly payment.  To avoid surprises, ask: “What does it mean if I lock my rate today?” “What rate lock time frame does this Loan Estimate provide?”“Is a shorter or longer rate lock available, and at what cost?” “What if my closing is delayed and the rate lock expires?”“If I lock my rate, are there any conditions under which my rate could still change?”There can be a downside to a rate lock.  It may be expensive to extend if your transaction needs more time.  And, a rate lock may lock you out of better market pricing if rates fall. Tip:You should make sure your rate lock agreement is long enough to cover the time until you close on your loan.  If you are concerned that your rate lock period might be too short, ask your lender about switching to a longer rate-lock period now. Tip:Your Loan Estimate will state whether or not your rate is locked but it will not provide you with information about how much it would cost to extend the rate lock, how much you are paying for the specific rate lock timeframe, or whether you could pay more or less for a different timeframe.  You should ask about those details.",/askcfpb/143/whats-a-lock-in-or-a-rate-lock.html,APPROVED,Mortgages,Applying for a mortgage,,<Question: 135 What is the difference between a mortgage interest rate and an APR?> | <Question: 144 What does it mean to apply for a loan or fill out a loan application?> | <Question: 1987 What information do I have to provide a lender in order to receive a Loan Estimate?>,Owning a Home

The first step is to request a Loan Estimate.To receive a Loan Estimate, you need to submit only six key pieces of information: Your name Your income Your Social Security number (so the lender can check your credit) The address of the home you plan to purchase or refinance An estimate of the home's value The loan amount you want to borrowAlthough you're not required to provide documents in order to get a Loan Estimate, it's a good idea to share what you have with the lender. The more information the lender has, the more accurate your Loan Estimate will be.It's a good idea to request Loan Estimates from several lenders. That way, you can compare your options and choose the best loan for you and your family. Each lender is required to send you a Loan Estimate within three business days of receiving your six key pieces of information.Once you're ready to choose a loan offer, you need to notify the lender that you are ready to proceed with the loan application. If you don't notify a lender that you'd like to proceed within 10 business days, the lender may revise the Loan Estimate or close your application as incomplete and you may need to start over. The 10 business days are calculated from when the lender delivers the Loan Estimate to you or places it in the mail, whichever is earlier.Once you've notified the lender that you would like to proceed with an application, the lender may ask you to provide additional information and documents to verify the information you have already submitted. The lender processes this information and may follow up with you to request additional information or clarification. Once the lender has received all the necessary information, the lender approves or denies your loan application. Note:  You won't receive a Loan Estimate if you applied for a mortgage prior to October 3, 2015, or if you're applying for a reverse mortgage.

153,What costs will I have to pay as part of taking out a mortgage loan?,,"There are several different kinds of costs you pay when taking out a mortgage.  Some of these costs are directly related to the mortgage – collectively, they make up the price of borrowing money.  These costs are the ones you should focus on when choosing a mortgage.  Other costs, such as property taxes, are often paid with your mortgage, but they’re really costs of homeownership. You would have to pay them whether or not you had a mortgage. These costs are important in deciding how much you can afford.  However, lenders don’t control these costs, so you shouldn’t make decisions about which lender to choose based on their estimates of these costs.You pay for a mortgage in two ways: upfront and over time.  When choosing a mortgage, it’s important to look at both types of costs.  A mortgage with a lower monthly payment may have higher upfront costs, or a mortgage with low upfront costs may have a higher monthly payment.    Monthly costs. Your monthly payment will typically contain four elements:Principal.  This is the money you borrowed and have to pay back.  This is part of the cost of buying your home, but not a cost of borrowing money.Interest. This is the primary cost of borrowing money, but not the only one.Mortgage insurance. This is an additional cost of borrowing money, typically required for borrowers who make a down payment of less than 20%.Property taxes and homeowners’ insurance.  These are costs of homeownership, not of borrowing money. They are usually bundled with your monthly payment and managed by the lender through an escrow account.In addition, you may pay for condominium or homeowner’s association dues. These costs are usually paid separately from your monthly payment.Learn more about these monthly costs.  Upfront costs. In addition to your down payment, you have to pay for several different kinds of costs at closing.  Origination and lender charges. These costs are charged by the lender for “originating,” or making you the loan.  They are part of the price of borrowing money.  Different lenders may choose to itemize these costs to varying degrees – it’s the overall total that matters.  Common charges are labeled origination fees, application fees, underwriting fees, processing fees, administrative fees, etc. Points. Points are a charge you pay upfront to the lender. Points are part of the price of borrowing money and are calculated as a percentage of the loan amount. You can choose whether or not to pay points. Learn more about points.Third-party closing costs.  These are charges for third-party services that are required to get a mortgage, such as appraisals and title insurance.  You can shop separately for some of these services.Taxes and government fees. These fees are charged by your local government.  They are charged in connection with the real estate transaction, but are usually not a cost of borrowing money.Prepaid expenses and deposits. These expenses may be associated with your loan or with homeownership. Typically, you need to pay the interest on your loan between the time you close and the end of that month. It’s also common to pay the first year’s homeowner’s insurance premium and make initial deposits into an escrow account to cover future homeowner’s insurance and property taxes.",/askcfpb/153/what-costs-will-i-have-to-pay-as-part-of-taking-out-a-mortgage-loan.html,APPROVED,Mortgages,Understanding mortgages | Applying for a mortgage,,"<Question: 136 What are discount points or points?> | <Question: 140 What is an escrow or impound account? > | <Question: 1941 On a mortgage, what?s the difference between my principal and interest payment and my total monthly payment?>",Owning a Home

When you purchase a home, you receive a document most often called a deed, which shows the seller transferred their legal ownership, or “title,” to the home to you.

However, it’s usually a good idea to do your own research about how much homeowner’s insurance costs.  You can shop separately for homeowner’s insurance, and choose the provider and plan that is right for you.  When you have a mortgage, your lender wants to make sure your property is protected by insurance. That’s why lenders generally require proof that you have homeowner’s insurance. If you don’t have insurance, your lender is allowed to buy it for you and charge you for it—but your lender must give you advance notice. If your lender buys insurance on your home because you did not keep up your homeowner’s insurance, that insurance may only cover the lender, and not you. It also may be more expensive than what you could buy on your own.  Homeowner’s insurance protects your property. Homeowner’s insurance is not the same as mortgage insurance.   Note:  You won’t receive a Loan Estimate if you applied for a mortgage prior to October 3, 2015, or if you're applying for a reverse mortgage. For those loans, you will receive two forms – a Good Faith Estimate (GFE) and an initial Truth-in-Lending disclosure  – instead of a Loan Estimate. Information about the cost of homeowner’s insurance can be found in Block 11 of your Good Faith Estimate (GFE). If you are applying for a HELOC, a manufactured housing loan that is not secured by real estate, or a loan through certain types of homebuyer assistance programs, you will not receive a GFE or a Loan Estimate, but you should receive a Truth-in-Lending disclosure.",/askcfpb/162/what-is-homeowners-insurance-why-is-homeowners-insurance-required.html,APPROVED,Mortgages,Applying for a mortgage | Definitions,,<Question: 140 What is an escrow or impound account? > | <Question: 219 My hazard insurance on my mortgage has been cancelled for failure to pay the insurance premium.

163,What is lender&#146;s title insurance?,,"Lender’s title insurance is usually required to get a mortgage loan. Lender’s title insurance protects your lender against problems with the title to your property—for example, if someone sues to say they have a claim against the home. Lender’s title insurance does not protect your investment in the home (your equity). If someone sues with a claim against your home, you are the first person responsible. The lender’s title insurance policy only covers claims that impact the lender’s loan. To protect your equity in the event of a title problem, you may want to purchase an owner’s title insurance policy.",/askcfpb/163/what-is-lenders-title-insurance.html,APPROVED,Mortgages,Applying for a mortgage | Definitions,,<Question: 158 The seller told me I have to purchase title insurance from a particular company or they won&#146;t sell me the house.

164,What is owner&#146;s title insurance?,,"When you purchase your home, you receive a document most often called a deed, which shows the seller transferred their legal ownership, or “title” to their home, to you. Title insurance can provide protection if someone later sues and says they have a claim against the home from before you purchased it. Common claims come from a previous owner’s failure to pay taxes or from contractors who say they were not paid for work done on the home before you purchased it.Most lenders require you to purchase a lender’s title insurance policy, which protects the amount they lend. You may want to buy an owner’s title insurance policy, which can help protect your financial investment in the home.You can usually shop for your title insurance provider separately from your mortgage. If you shop for title insurance, you may be able to save money. If you choose to buy owner’s title insurance, the total cost will usually be lower if you use the same provider for both the lender’s policy and the owner’s policy, compared to buying them separately.Depending on the state where you are buying your home, your title insurance company may give you an itemized list of fees at closing, which may be different than what is shown on your Loan Estimate or Closing Disclosure. This does not necessarily mean you are being charged more. Note:  You won’t receive a Loan Estimate if you applied for a mortgage prior to October 3, 2015, or if you're applying for a reverse mortgage. For those loans , you will receive two forms – a Good Faith Estimate (GFE) and an initial a Truth-in-Lending disclosure – instead of a Loan Estimate. On the GFE, title services and lender’s title insurance are listed in Block 4 and owner’s title insurance is listed in Block 5.

TIP: Check with your lender and title insurance company to see if an updated survey is acceptable.

It describes what makes it valuable and may show how it compares to other properties in the neighborhood. An appraisal helps assure you and your lender that the value of the property is based on facts, not just the seller’s opinion.When you borrow money to buy or refinance a home, your lender may need to get a new appraisal and may require you to pay for it. Your lender may also use other ways to check the value of the home. For a typical home loan (that is, a loan secured by a first mortgage on your residential real estate), you are entitled to receive a copy of appraisals and opinions of value your lender gets. You should receive them soon after they are delivered to the lender in complete form—no later than three days before closing.You can’t be charged a fee for copies of an appraisal or other valuation. But you can be charged a reasonable fee for the lender’s cost of preparing the appraisal or other valuation.",/askcfpb/167/what-is-an-appraisal.html,APPROVED,Mortgages,Applying for a mortgage | Definitions,,<Question: 148 I never received a &#147;Good Faith Estimate&#148; or GFE.

172,Can my final mortgage costs increase from what was on my Loan Estimate?,,"Some mortgage costs can increase at closing, but others can't. It is illegal for lenders to deliberately underestimate the costs on your Loan Estimate. However, lenders are allowed to change some costs under certain circumstances. Interest rateIf your interest rate is not locked, it can change at any time. Even if your interest rate is locked, your interest rate can change if there are changes to your application information or if you do not close within the rate-lock timeframe. Check at the top of page 1 of your Loan Estimate to see whether your rate is locked, and until when. Learn more about how rate locks work. Closing costsThere are three categories of closing costs. Some closing costs the lender can increase by any amount, some the lender can increase by up to 10 percent, and some the lender can’t increase at all.However, under certain circumstances these rules do not apply. For example, your lender is allowed to change your closing costs without restriction if: You decided to get a different kind of loan or change the amount of your down payment; The appraisal on the home you want to buy came in higher or lower than expected; You took out a new loan or missed a payment and that has changed your credit; orYour lender could not document your overtime, bonus, or other income.  These types of situations are called a “change in circumstances.” Costs that can increase by any amountThese costs are not controlled by the lender, and can increase by any amount at any time:Prepaid interest, property insurance premiums, or initial escrow account depositsFees for services required by the lender that you have shopped separately for, if you choose a service provider that is not on the lender’s written list of providers Fees for third-party services that the lender does not require Costs that cannot increase at all If there is a “change in circumstances,” these costs can change by any amount, but otherwise they cannot change at all:Fees paid to the lender, mortgage broker, or an affiliate of either the lender or mortgage broker for a required serviceFees for required service that the lender did not allow you to shop separately for, when the provider is not affiliated with the lender or mortgage broker Transfer taxes Costs that can increase by up to 10 percentIf there is a “change in circumstances,” these costs can change by any amount. If there is no change in circumstances, then the total of these costs cannot increase by more than 10 percent: Recording feesFees for required services when you have chosen a third-party service provider on the lender’s written list of providers (if the provider is an affiliate of the lender, the cost cannot change at all) What happens when the costs change?If your application has a “change in circumstances,” you will likely receive a revised Loan Estimate. If the costs have increased more than the allowed limits and your application has not had a “change in circumstances,” you are entitled to a refund of the amount above the allowable limits.

176,"What is a mortgage ""closing""? What happens at the closing?","The “closing” is the last step in buying and financing a home. The “closing,” also called “settlement,” is when you and all the other parties in a mortgage loan transaction sign the necessary documents.","After signing these documents, you become responsible for the mortgage loan. If you’re purchasing a home with a loan, the closing of your loan (the time when your loan becomes final and the funds are distributed) and the closing of your home purchase (when you become owner of your new home) typically happen at the same time. Once the closing is complete, you are legally required to repay the mortgage.Your closing may include some or all of these entities: Your title insurance company An escrow company Your lenderYour attorney (if you come from a state where attorneys conduct closings, or if you hire legal representation for your closing) The seller’s attorneyDepending on what state you live in, all the parties may sit around a table and sign all the documents at once. Or the closing could take several weeks as the signatures of each party are collected separately. Some companies allow you to electronically sign documents, either in advance of closing or at the closing table. A closing may even be conducted by mail or even on the internet.Regardless of who performs the closing or where it occurs, there will be many important documents that you’ll need to sign that will have lasting financial implications on your life.  Tip: Before you sign, make sure you carefully read and understand all the loan documents. Don’t sign the loan documents if the loan is different from what you expected. Don’t sign the documents if you can’t make the payments, if you find any errors, or if you do not understand the loan terms.Be sure to understand how your payments may change over time. With an adjustable-rate mortgage , your payments may increase over time, and it is important to understand when the payment can change and by how much. Even with a fixed-rate mortgage, your total monthly payment  may change due to changes in your taxes or insurance.   Tip: Familiarize yourself with some of the key documents you will be signing so that you know what to look for when you get them.

177,Do I need an attorney or anyone else to represent me when closing on a mortgage?,,"It depends. Depending on your state’s laws, you may not be required to have an attorney at the closing. However, you can choose to have an attorney review your documents before closing. Technically, unless you hire an attorney to represent you at closing, no one else participating in  the closing exclusively represents your interests. It’s important to understand that other attorneys present at the closing – for example, the lender’s or seller’s attorney – do not represent you. These people may not be able to answer your questions and are required to act in the lender’s or seller’s interests, not yours.While some states require that there be an attorney present at closing, note that this attorney has a primary responsibility to the lender. If this is your first home purchase you may consider having your own legal representation. Your real estate agent or mortgage broker can provide recommendations if you do not have an attorney.   Tip:If you need help finding an attorney, your county bar association may provide a referral list, or you can find lawyer referrals in your county and state by visiting the American Bar Association website.

183,What do I do if the terms of my mortgage loan at closing are not what I was promised beforehand?,,"Don’t sign the closing documents if the loan is not what you were promised. You don’t have to sign anything at closing unless you are satisfied with the terms. The lender owes you an explanation of why the terms have changed.  Don’t sign any papers until you are satisfied with the terms as written in the documents. There are always other options.  If you are refinancing, then you can renegotiate with the lender, or cancel the closing and look for a new lender.  If you are using the mortgage to buy a new home, you still have options. You can ask the lender why you are not being given the loan you were promised and insist upon the promised terms. You can also negotiate with the seller for more time to find a new lender. However, your purchase contract with the seller may limit the amount of time you have to purchase the home. There may also be legal or financial consequences if you break the promises you made in the contract with the seller.  Tip: Walking away from a purchase loan closing isn’t easy, but it may be preferable to agreeing to a loan that is more expensive than what you were promised.   Explore your options. Review your sales contract and consult with an attorney or trusted advisor.  You might ask the seller for more time so that you can negotiate with the lender or find a new lender. Never sign any papers until you’re satisfied that you understand what has changed and why, and that you can afford the new loan terms.   Tip: Don’t sign any papers you don’t understand. Review your contract or seek the advice of an attorney to determine what options you have if you decide not to sign a particular loan.If you need help finding an attorney, you can get a referral from your county bar association or  or you can find lawyer referrals in your county and state by visiting the American Bar Association website.

184,"What should I do if my mortgage lender quoted me one rate at application, but raised it at the closing? ",,"First, ask your lender to explain why your rate or fees have changed. There may be a specific reason – if something important has changed or wasn’t included in your original Loan Estimate, for example, or if your income or assets turned out to be different from what you had estimated at the time of application. It’s not uncommon for some closing costs to change somewhat, but there are legal rules about what can change and by how much. Learn more about which fees can change and which can’t. If you have a rate lock, your rate and points should not change, but there are exceptions. Rate locks typically only guarantee your rate if nothing changes about your application.  If something important changes – for example, the home is appraised at less than the sale price, or your lender cannot verify your income – then your rate may change.  If you have a rate lock and your rate has changed, ask your lender to explain why. Learn more about how rate locks work.If you’re not satisfied with your lender’s explanation, you can always stop working with that lender. If the rate or fees have changed significantly, and you are unable to reach an acceptable solution with your lender, consider other options. You can choose another lender.  You may be able to negotiate with the seller to delay the closing until you can arrange for a new loan with a different lender. Even if you decide to work with a different lender, you may have rights to compensation from the first lender if the changes were illegal. You may want to consider calling an attorney. You can also submit a complaint to the CFPB online or by calling (855) 411-CFPB (2372).

185,"At the mortgage loan closing, do I have to sign if I don't like the terms?",,"No.  You don’t have to sign anything unless you're satisfied with the terms.  Warning: You should never sign anything that you don't understand. Don't sign if you don't understand the mortgage terms or if you think that you won't be able to pay back the loan.If you are borrowing money to buy a home, you likely have a contract with the seller. The contract may limit the amount of time and flexibility you have to close the sale. The contract may also subject you to legal action if you break it.Review your contract or seek the advice of an attorney to determine what options you have if you decide not to take the home loan offered for the closing.  You may be able to secure a new mortgage or extend the period to close the sale. However, if you can't do so, you may lose the deposit you paid to the seller when you entered into an agreement to buy their home. The seller may have other legal rights against you.  Tip: If you have a contract with the seller, review the “mortgage of financing clause” in your sales contract. This will tell you whether your deposit will be refunded if the sale is cancelled because you are unable to get a loan. Tip: If you are in the process of refinancing your existing mortgage, you don't have any contractual obligation to sign the documents.

186,"Can I change my mind after I sign the loan closing documents for my mortgage or refinance? What is the ""right of rescission?""",,"Yes. For certain types of mortgages, after you sign your mortgage closing documents, you may be able to change your mind.  You have the right to cancel, also known as the right of rescission, for most non-purchase money mortgages. A non-purchase money mortgage is a mortgage that is not used to buy the home. Refinances and home equity loans are examples of non-purchase money mortgages.This right gives you three business days to cancel a non-purchase money mortgage agreement. In this case, business days include Saturdays, but not Sundays or legal public holidays. The three-day clock does not start until all three of the following events have happened: You sign the credit contract (usually known as the Promissory Note)You receive a Truth in Lending disclosure (in most circumstances, this will be your Closing Disclosure form)  You receive two copies of a notice explaining your right to rescind  If you decide you want to rescind a non-purchase money mortgage: You must notify your lender in writing that you are cancelling the loan contract and exercising your right to rescind. You may use the form provided to you by your lender or a letter. You can't rescind just by calling or visiting the lender. Within 20 calendar days after your lender receives your notice of rescission, all money or property you paid as part of the mortgage transaction must be returned to you. Tip: In some cases, if the lender doesn’t give you your Truth-in-Lending disclosure (which in most cases will be a Closing Disclosure) or two copies of the notice of the right to cancel, or if the lender makes certain important mistakes on your Truth-in-Lending disclosure, you may have the right to cancel the loan for up to three years. If you think this may apply to you, you should consult a lawyer right away. Note:   If you applied for your mortgage on or after October 3, 2015, in most cases your Truth-in-Lending disclosure will be the Closing Disclosure. Tip: Whatever form of written notice you use, make sure it is delivered or mailed before midnight of the third business day after your closing and keep a copy for yourself. Warning: Your right to rescind doesn't change your obligation to make payments on any of your other loans. If you refinance and then rescind the refinance loan, you will still have to pay the original loan. Tip: If you have the right to rescind, you can cancel your loan in the three-day window for any reason or no reason at all.   Tip: If you have a problem with your mortgage closing process, you should discuss the issue or matter with your lender.

With these loans, the borrower can postpone making principal payments for a while. Eventually, though, the borrower has to start paying principal and that will make the monthly payments go up.Even if you have a fixed rate loan, your payments may change if you are paying your taxes and insurance through an escrow account maintained by your servicer.

200,Is there a limit on how much my mortgage lender can make me pay each month for insurance and taxes (the escrow?),,"Yes. There's a limit on how much the lender can make you pay into escrow.An escrow account is not required for every loan. But it can be an important protection for you, because it helps make sure that money is there when you need it to pay taxes and insurance. Failing to pay taxes and insurance can be expensive and can cause lots of hassles.Before your loan closes, the lender will estimate the total annual expenses that need to be paid from the escrow account. You can be required to pay a part of the estimated annual total in advance, but no more than a maximum of one-sixth of the total (this gives you a two-month “cushion”). On top of the cushion, every month, your servicer can require you to pay one-twelfth of the total annual escrow payments the servicer reasonably anticipates paying out of the escrow account.If you have a loan that’s considered “higher-priced,”  then you might be required to pay into an escrow account for the first five years of the loan. Some loan types require escrow for the entire term of the loan. You’ll be notified if your loan is in this category, or if there’s an exception that applies to you.

201,Do I ever have to buy property or flood insurance from my lender?,,"No. You may shop for property or flood insurance. But if you do not get homeowner’s insurance, or let your policy lapse, your lender may insure your property and charge you for it. This is called “force-placed” or “collateral protection” insurance. It is usually much more expensive than a regular policy. A lender may also buy “force-placed” flood insurance for homeowners in flood zones who do not have adequate flood insurance to meet the legal minimum required to protect the property. If you can obtain your own insurance, it will generally be less expensive than the insurance bought by your lender for you. In some cases of force-placed insurance, the policy that the lender buys protects their interest but not your interest in the property. If you believe that any force-placed insurance was purchased in error, you should contact your lender immediately and give proof of your current insurance policy.  TIP: If you disagree with your lender’s determination that you need flood insurance, you can review the FEMA flood maps. If you think there has been an error, you can ask FEMA to issue a Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA), or a Letter of Map Revision Based on Fill (LOMR-F).  TIP: If your loan doesn’t include an escrow account, you will have to plan for potentially large property-related expenses, such as property taxes and homeowner’s insurance premiums. Be sure you budget for your monthly mortgage payments plus these extra costs and stay current on your taxes and insurance payments. If you fail to pay your property taxes, your state or local government may impose fines and penalties or place a tax lien on your home. In addition, if you fail to pay any of your property-related costs, your lender may add the amounts to your loan balance, add an escrow account to your loan, or require you to pay for insurance on your home that your lenders buys on your behalf, which likely would be more expensive and provide fewer benefits than what you could obtain on your own.",/askcfpb/201/do-i-ever-have-to-buy-property-or-flood-insurance-from-my-lender.html,APPROVED,Mortgages,Applying for a mortgage | Other mortgage questions,,<Question: 130 What is the difference between a mortgage broker and a mortgage lender? > | <Question: 140 What is an escrow or impound account? > | <Question: 159 What are government recording charges?>,Owning a Home
202,When can I remove private mortgage insurance (PMI) from my loan?,"For many mortgages, Federal law provides rights to remove PMI under certain circumstances.  Some lenders and servicers may also allow for earlier removal of PMI under their own standards.","The federal Homeowners Protection Act provides rights to remove PMI under certain circumstances. These rights apply to mortgages related to single-family principal residences, closed on or after July 29, 1999. The law generally provides two ways for you to remove PMI from your home loan: canceling PMI or PMI termination. Request PMI cancellationThe Homeowners Protection Act gives you the right to request that your servicer cancel PMI when you have reached the date when the principal balance of your mortgage is scheduled to fall to 80 percent of the original value of your home. This date should have been given to you in writing on a PMI disclosure form when you received your mortgage. If you can't find the disclosure form, contact your servicer. You can also make this request earlier if you have made additional payments that reduce the principal balance of your mortgage to 80 percent of the original value of your home. For this purpose, “original value” generally means either the contract sales price or the appraised value of your home at the time you purchased it, whichever is lower (or, if you have refinanced, the appraised value at the time you refinanced). There are other important criteria you must meet if you want to cancel PMI on your loan: Your request must be in writing. You must have a good payment history and be current on your payments. Your lender may require you to certify that there are no junior liens (such as a second mortgage) on your home.Your lender can also require you to provide evidence (for example, an appraisal) that the value of your property hasn’t declined below the value of the home when you first bought it. If the value of your home has decreased, you may not be able to cancel PMI.Automatic PMI terminationEven if you don’t ask your servicer to cancel PMI, your servicer still must terminate PMI on the date when your principal balance is scheduled to reach 78 percent of the original value of your home. For your PMI to be cancelled on that date, you need to be current on your payments on the anticipated termination date. Otherwise, PMI will not be terminated until shortly after your payments are brought up to date.Final PMI terminationThere is one other way you can stop paying for PMI. If you are current on payments, your lender or servicer must end the PMI the month after you reach the midpoint of your loan’s amortization schedule. The termination applies even if you have not reached 78 percent of the original value of your home. The midpoint of your loan’s amortization schedule is halfway through the full term of your loan. For 30-year loans, the midpoint would be after 15 years have passed. This standard for ending the PMI halfway through the loan’s term is more likely to occur for people who have a mortgage with an interest-only period, principal forbearance, or a balloon payment. Keep in mind that you must be current on your monthly payments for termination to occur. If your loan is guaranteed by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) or Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), these rules generally won’t apply. If you have questions about mortgage insurance on an FHA or VA loan, contact your servicer.If you have lender-paid mortgage insurance, different rules apply. For more information about home loans, visit our mortgage page.",/askcfpb/202/when-can-i-remove-private-mortgage-pmi-insurance-from-my-loan.html,SUBMITTED,Mortgages,Applying for a mortgage | Maintaining a mortgage,,<Question: 122 What is private mortgage insurance?

Check your monthly mortgage statement.  If your monthly mortgage payment includes the amount you have to pay into your escrow account, so if your taxes or premiums go up then your payment will also go up.You may have been assessed fees that increased your monthly payment.

224,What is a reverse mortgage?,,"A reverse mortgage is a special type of loan that allows older homeowners to borrow against the equity (wealth) in their homes. Here’s how a reverse mortgage works:It is called a “reverse” mortgage because, instead of making payments to the lender, you receive money from the lender. The money you receive, and the interest charged on the loan, increase the balance of your loan each month. Over time, the loan amount grows. Since equity is the value of your home minus any loans, you have less and less equity in your home as your loan balance increases. Not everyone is eligible. To qualify for a reverse mortgage: You must be at least 62 years old. Your home must be your primary residence.You must have paid off some, or all, of your traditional mortgage. Read more about reverse mortgage eligibility here. Tip: If you or your parents are considering a reverse mortgage, make sure you get all the facts first: Check out the other reverse-mortgage related questions on Ask CFPB. Download this helpful consumer guide from the CFPB's Office for Older Americans. Talk to a reverse-mortgage counselor.

225,How is a reverse mortgage different from a traditional mortgage?,,"A traditional mortgage is used to buy or refinance a home. The lender lends you the money to buy or refinance the home. In exchange, you promise to pay back the lender the money you borrowed, plus interest, over many years.A reverse mortgage is typically used to get cash out of your home. Instead of borrowing to buy a home, you are borrowing against a home that you already own. This allows you to use the cash now for expenses, and pay back the loan when you die or sell the home. Reverse mortgages are designed for older homeowners who want to access their home equity (the wealth stored in their homes). In order to get a reverse mortgage you must be at least 62 years old and have paid off most, or all, of your mortgage.Unlike traditional mortgages, reverse mortgages do not require monthly mortgage payments. The interest and fees on the mortgage are added to your loan balance each month. Over time, your home equity will decrease as your loan balance grows. It’s the reverse of a traditional mortgage.If you are interested in purchasing a new home (for example, to downsize or move closer to family), you can sometimes use a reverse mortgage for this. You’ll need a higher down payment than with a traditional mortgage, but you won’t have to make monthly mortgage payments. Learn more about the program, known as HECM for Purchase. Tip: It's your house. Understand what you could be putting at risk. Before you borrow against your house, make sure you understand how the loan works. A great way to test if you understand the loan is to explain it to a friend or family member in your own words.Be careful when considering a reverse mortgage. There are many factors to consider, including your age, your financial needs and goals, and how long you expect to stay in the house. If you decide it makes sense for you to take out the loan, learn about all the fees and compare interest rates before you sign anything.

226,Are there different types of reverse mortgages?,,"Yes. Most reverse mortgages today are insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), as part of its Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) program. If you apply for a HECM loan, you can choose from the following options:Payment of loan proceeds. You can receive loan money as a line of credit, monthly installment, a combination of these, or a lump sum. Interest rate. You can choose between a fixed interest rate and an adjustable interest rate. Fixed interest rates are only available with the lump-sum payment option.  The HECM program also offers two special-purpose loan options for special circumstances: HECM for Purchase. HECM for Purchase allows you to purchase a home using money from a reverse mortgage loan.HECM Refinance. HECM Refinance allows one HECM loan to be converted into another HECM loan. The typical reason for refinancing is to get a lower interest rate, if one is available, or to borrow more cash, if the home value has gone up. Tip:  Choosing a line of credit or monthly payout will increase the amount that you can borrow overall. Learn more. Non-HECM Reverse Mortgages Single-purpose reverse mortgages are also offered by some state and local governments and non-profit organizations. These are used only for the purpose specified by the lender (for example home repairs or property taxes). They may only be available in some areas for homeowners with low to moderate income. These non-HECM reverse mortgages are not federally insured.Some lenders also offer proprietary reverse mortgages, which are not federally insured. These are typically designed for borrowers with higher home values. Tip:Ask your reverse mortgage counselor to help you compare options. To find a HUD-approved counselor, visit HUD's counselor search page or call HUD's housing counselor referral line (1-800-569-4287).HUD is the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development.

227,Can anyone apply for a reverse mortgage loan?,,"No. There are certain requirements you must meet in order to be eligible for a reverse mortgage: You must be at least 62 years old. The home must be your primary residence.You must have paid off most, or all, of your traditional mortgage.If you still owe money on a traditional mortgage, you must use part of the money from your reverse mortgage to pay off the traditional mortgage. There are limits to how much money you can borrow. So, if you still owe a lot of money on your traditional mortgage, you might not qualify for a reverse mortgage.Most reverse mortgages today are insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) through its Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) program. This program requires that you meet with a reverse mortgage counselor to discuss how a reverse mortgage works and how much it will cost you. The counselor must be approved by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). FHA also requires that your home be in good shape. If your home is poorly maintained, you may need to repair it before you can get a HECM reverse mortgage.If you have a spouse or other relatives living with you, think very carefully before applying for a reverse mortgage. Couples can apply together as co-borrowers, and for most couples this is the best choice if they decide to pursue a reverse mortgage. When couples are listed as co-borrowers on their reverse mortgage, one spouse can continue to live in the home even if the other spouse dies or has to move to a nursing home. Unmarried couples, siblings, etc., can also apply together as co-borrowers and receive the same rights, as long as both people are over age 62. Warning: People who live in the house and are not co-borrowers will probably have to move when the borrower dies or moves out.

228,How do I know that a reverse mortgage is a good idea for me?,There are a lot of factors to consider before you consider applying for a reverse mortgage. One factor is how much it will cost.,"It’s usually a good idea to discuss important financial decisions with friends, family, or someone you trust. Here are some questions to consider before applying for a reverse mortgage:Is there another, cheaper way for you to achieve your financial goal?Before tapping into your home equity, see if you can find a way to lower your expenses. If you need extra money to cover living expenses, see if you qualify for a state or local program to lower your bills. You might also consider downsizing to a more affordable home.Do you need to tap into your home equity now or should you save it for an emergency? Home equity is often the last resource to turn to in a financial emergency. It is usually best to preserve your equity if you have other resources to meet financial needs. However, if you think you may need to access your equity, speak with a housing counselor and a trusted financial adviser now, rather than later. A financial plan will help you avoid last minute financial decisions in an emergency.Are you on a fixed income with no other assets?If you don’t have much income, a reverse mortgage might not be the best option for you. If you take out a reverse mortgage loan and then have trouble paying your property taxes and homeowner’s insurance, you could face foreclosure. Another option might be to downsize. If you sell your home and use money from the sale to buy a more affordable one, you could be more financially secure in the long run.Do you have children or other heirs to whom you plan to leave your home?Taking out a reverse mortgage can jeopardize your ability to leave your home to your heirs. If this is a priority for you, think twice about a reverse mortgage.How long do you and your family plan to live in the home?In most cases, a reverse mortgage makes more sense if you plan to live in your current home for a long time. Reverse mortgages can be an expensive way to borrow money if you don’t plan to stay in your home for many years. Here’s why: Most reverse mortgages require you to pay insurance premiums. The insurance is there in case your loan balance grows to be more than your home is worth. With insurance, you won’t have to pay the difference. But, if you only stay in your home for a short period of time, chances are you are paying for insurance you don’t need. If you only plan to stay in your home for a short period of time, the loan balance is less likely to grow to more than your home value.Reverse mortgages can also have high upfront costs. If you sell your house within a few years, you won’t have gotten as much benefit from those costs than if you stayed in your home for a longer time.How much will it cost you in fees to obtain a reverse mortgage?Fees vary depending on the type of reverse mortgage that you choose.  Fees and other charges can be high in some cases, so it is important to shop around for the best deal.How will you pay for property taxes and homeowner's insurance?It’s important to have a plan for how you will pay for property taxes and homeowner’s insurance. If you fall behind on either one, the lender could foreclose on your reverse mortgage and you could be forced to move.Does your spouse or partner want to keep living in the house if you die?Discuss this question carefully with your partner. If you take out a reverse mortgage without your partner as a co-borrower, then your partner will have to move out or repay the loan if you die. If your partner is a co-borrower, both you and your partner will be able to keep living in the house after one of you dies. Tip:  Talk to a housing counselor who’s been approved by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Visit HUD's counselor search page or call HUD’s housing counselor referral line (800) 569-4287. HUD-approved counselors may charge a fee, typically $125 or less. Tip: Be careful about taking out a reverse mortgage as part of an investment strategy. There is no such thing as a risk-free or guaranteed investment. It’s usually a very bad idea to borrow against your home to invest in stocks, bonds or other financial products. All investments can lose value. That means you could risk losing your home, especially if you experience a financial shock if a loss to your investments makes it hard for you to keep up with your expenses.",/askcfpb/228/how-do-i-know-that-a-reverse-mortgage-is-a-good-idea-for-me.html,APPROVED,Mortgages,Reverse mortgages,Older Americans,<Question: 230 What should I discuss with a housing counselor to make sure I fully understand what getting a reverse mortgage will mean for me?> | <Question: 236 When do I have to pay back a reverse mortgage loan? > | <Question: 237 What are the costs I will have to pay for a reverse mortgage?>,Mortgage Complaint

233,How do I receive the money from a reverse mortgage loan?,,"This depends on the type of loan, the lender you choose, and the payment option that you select.Most reverse mortgages today are insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) as part of its Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) program. With a HECM loan, you can receive your money in one of 3 ways: as a line of credit, in monthly installments, or a lump sum. You can also get a combination of monthly installments and a line of credit. As of October 1, 2013, there is a cap on the amount you can take out in the first year. Your lender will calculate for you how much you are authorized to borrow overall, based on your age, the interest rate, and the value of your home. This number is known as your initial principal limit.Generally, you can take out up to 60% of your initial principal limit in the first year. However, if the amount you owe on an existing mortgage (or other required payments) is more than 60% of your initial principal limit, you can take out enough to pay off your mortgage (and any other required payments, including upfront loan fees) plus additional cash of up to 10% of your initial principal limit. This first-year withdrawal cap applies to all 3 payout options. Tip:  Don’t pay more interest and mortgage insurance than you have to – take out loan money only as you need it.The line of credit option allows you to draw on your loan at the times and amounts that you choose (subject to the first-year cap and the overall initial principal limit). You will only be charged interest on the amount of money you take out. You will not be charged interest on the money remaining in your credit line, which you can take out at a later date.This option also features credit line growth. With a line of credit, the amount that you can borrow will increase over time. The growth applies to the unused funds remaining in your credit line. The less you take out upfront, the more you will be able to borrow later.  As long as you continue to meet the requirements of your reverse mortgage, your credit line cannot be frozen or canceled. The monthly “tenure” option allows you to receive a monthly payout from your lender for as long as you continue to live in your home.The monthly “term” plan is a similar option, but you only receive the monthly payout for a fixed number of years. The payouts will be larger than under the “tenure” option, and you get to choose how many years you would like.You can combine a line of credit with either the monthly tenure or monthly term payouts. The line of credit, monthly payouts, and combination options are only available with an adjustable rate loan.With the fixed-rate, lump-sum option, you will receive your entire loan proceeds upfront and you will receive a fixed interest rate. However, you will only be able to access the amount permitted under the first-year withdrawal limits. The remaining loan amount is forfeited. This means most borrowers will not be able to borrow as much with a fixed-rate, lump-sum loan than with an adjustable-rate, line of credit or monthly payout option.Once you have selected a payout option, you may be able to change it for a fee – as long as you haven’t drawn all of your funds already.Some lenders may offer a proprietary (non-FHA insured) reverse mortgage. If you are considering a proprietary reverse mortgage, make sure you understand your options for receiving your money, as they may differ from the options for HECM loans.

235,Do I still need to pay my property taxes and home insurance with a reverse mortgage loan?,,"Yes. Reverse mortgage loans do not change your obligation to pay your homeowner’s insurance and taxes. If you don’t pay your insurance and taxes, or if you allow the condition of your property to deteriorate without making the necessary repairs, you will be considered in default on your loan. If you don’t work with your lender to resolve the situation, the lender could foreclose on your home and you could be forced to move. Learn more about what to do if you are having trouble paying your taxes and insurance.For many people, it is much easier to pay taxes and insurance in 12 small monthly installments than it is to pay a large bill once a year. When you were buying your home with a traditional mortgage, chances are you paid your taxes and insurance to your lender as part of monthly mortgage payment. This is called an escrow  arrangement. Starting in early 2014, reverse mortgage lenders will begin offering similar escrow arrangements for reverse mortgages. Under a reverse mortgage escrow arrangement, you make monthly payments to your lender for taxes and insurance, and your lender takes care of paying the tax and insurance bills. For some borrowers with limited income, escrow arrangements may be required. If you are interested in setting up an escrow arrangement, ask your lender.

236,When do I have to pay back a reverse mortgage loan? ,,"It depends on your situation. Most reverse mortgages today are insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), as part of its Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) program. A HECM reverse mortgage loan has to be completely paid off when the last surviving borrower dies, sells the home, or permanently moves out. A “permanent move” is defined as living somewhere else for one continuous year. For instance, a borrower who stays in a nursing home or assisted living for more than 12 continuous months has made a “permanent move.” The loan also becomes due if you stop paying your property taxes or homeowner’s insurance, or fail to maintain the property in good repair. For more specifics, look up your situation on this list: If you are the only borrower on the HECM reverse mortgage loan and:You live alone, your loan will have to be paid off when you die, sell the home, or move out.You live with a spouse or partner, your loan will have to be paid off when you die, sell the home, or move out.Warning: If you or your spouse/partner cannot afford to repay the loan from other funds, your spouse or partner will most likely have to move.You live with children, other relatives, or unrelated roommates, your loan will have to be paid off when you die, sell the home, or move out.Warning: If you or your heirs cannot afford to repay the loan from other funds, your children, relatives, and/or roommates will most likely have to move. If you are a co-borrower on the reverse mortgage and:You live alone, your loan will have to be paid off when you die, sell the home, or move out.You live with a spouse or partner, your loan will have to be paid off when both you and your co-borrower have died or moved out. Your co-borrower can continue to live in the home without paying off the loan after you die or move out. Likewise, you can continue to live in the home without paying off the loan if your co-borrower dies or moves out.You live with children, other relatives, or unrelated roommates, your loan will have to be paid off when both you and your co-borrower have died or moved out. If you or your co-borrower is still living in the home, then your children or other relatives can continue to live there too. But when both you and your co-borrower have died or moved out, the loan must be paid off.Warning: If you or your heirs cannot afford to repay the loan from other funds, your children, relatives, and/or roommates will most likely have to move. Note:Usually, co-borrowers are spouses or partners. Co-borrowers are treated the same whether they are spouses, partners, relatives or just roommates.

237,What are the costs I will have to pay for a reverse mortgage?,"The cost of a reverse mortgage will depend on the type of loan you choose, how much money you take out upfront, and the lender that you choose. They are usually more expensive than other home loans.","With a reverse mortgage, you’ll be charged in two ways: upfront and over time.Upfront costs include lender fees, upfront mortgage insurance, and real estate closing costs. Your upfront mortgage insurance charge is based on the size of your loan, and how much you choose to take out in the first year. Find out more about upfront costs and why the amount of loan funds you take out upfront matters.Many borrowers choose to pay for the upfront costs using their loan funds, rather than paying them out of pocket. Paying for upfront costs with loan funds is more expensive than paying them out of pocket. Learn why. Costs over time include interest and ongoing mortgage insurance premiums. The interest rate you pay depends on what lender you choose. Choosing a loan with a lower interest rate can make a big difference. Take the time to compare quotes from multiple lenders so you can compare your interest rate. You interest rate may be fixed or adjustable. Mortgage insurance adds an additional 1.25% on top of the interest rate.Each month, interest and mortgage insurance charges are calculated based on the current loan balance. These charges are added to your loan balance. The amount you pay in interest and mortgage insurance compounds the same way a balance on a credit card does. The loan balance used to calculate interest and mortgage insurance charges each month includes prior months’ interest and mortgage insurance charges. As your loan balance grows, the amount of the interest and mortgage insurance charged that month also grows. Tip:  Don’t pay more interest and mortgage insurance than you have to – take out loan money only as you need it.The specific costs and cautions listed here are for Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) reverse mortgages. HECMs are insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA).  In addition to HECM mortgages, some lenders may offer proprietary (non-FHA insured) reverse mortgages, which may have different costs. Tip: If you’re considering a reverse mortgage, you (and your spouse or partner) should talk with a reverse mortgage counselor to help you decide if a reverse mortgage is right for you.

The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has a “HECM for Purchase” program that allows seniors, age 62 or older, to purchase a home using a reverse mortgage. You will need a much larger down payment than with a traditional mortgage, but like all reverse mortgages, you will not have to make payments on the loan as long as you meet all the requirements of the loan.

If your contractor tells you that you have to get a reverse mortgage in order to have repairs done, you should think twice about using that contractor’s services.A reverse mortgage may be a good way to pay for needed repairs if you are short on cash, but there may be less expensive options.Some local areas offer grants or low-cost, single-purpose loans for older homeowners who need help paying for home repairs.

241,What happens with my reverse mortgage if my spouse dies?,,"It depends. It will depend on whether you and your spouse are listed as co-owners on the property deed and as co-borrowers on the reverse mortgage loan.Reverse mortgage loans generally require that all property owners be listed as borrowers and that all borrowers meet the minimum age requirement. If you are a co-owner and co-borrower, you can continue living in the home even if your spouse dies or moves out. Sometimes, only one of the spouses is listed as a borrower on the loan. Example: Let’s say you were not yet 62 years old when your spouse took out the loan. You would not have qualified to be a co-borrower. If the home and the reverse mortgage are in your spouse’s name only – and you are not listed as a co-owner and co-borrower– you typically will not be able to keep the home unless you can repay the entire loan balance in full when your spouse dies or moves out.Lenders will sometimes suggest changing the title or ownership of your home to qualify for a reverse mortgage, or to qualify for more loan proceeds. This is very risky. Tip: If you are considering something like changing the title or ownership of your home, make sure to talk with a lawyer and discuss your plans with trusted family or friends.

Most reverse mortgages today are insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA)’s Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) program. A HECM reverse mortgage loan must be paid off completely when the last surviving borrower dies or no longer lives in the home.If your heirs don’t want to, or cannot afford to, pay off the loan they will need to sell the home in order to repay the loan. If your home is worth more than the loan balance, then they’ll get to keep the difference. If your home is worth less than the loan balance, your heirs won’t owe any additional money beyond what the home is worth.On the other hand, if your heirs want to keep the home, they’ll need to pay off the loan immediately. If your heirs cannot afford to pay off the loan in cash, they may be able to pay off the loan by taking out a new mortgage just as if they were buying a new home. However, they’ll need to meet all the requirements of a regular mortgage, such as stable income, a credit check, and possibly a down payment.If the loan balance is more than your home is worth, your heirs will typically only have to pay what the home is worth, not the full loan balance. With a HECM loan, your heirs can satisfy the loan by paying 95 percent of the appraised value of your home. It can be tricky to figure out when your loan must be paid off.

Note:A stay in a nursing home, with relatives, or in assisted living for less than 12 months will not affect your reverse mortgage. As long as it lasts less than 12 months, you can keep your home and come back to it afterwards. Tip: Some loans, known as proprietary loans, are not part of the HECM program and are not FHA insured.

A HECM reverse mortgage loan must be paid off completely when the last surviving borrower permanently moves out of the home.

244,How much money can I get from my home with a reverse mortgage?,"Generally, the amount you will be able to borrow from a reverse mortgage will be larger the older you are, the more valuable your home is, and the lower the interest rate.","To start, you can use a reverse mortgage calculator to get a general idea of how much you may be eligible to borrow. The National Council on Aging provides a reverse mortgage calculator and other resources online. Limits for withdrawals during the first year. As of October 1, 2013, there is a cap on the amount you can take out in the first year. Your lender will calculate for you how much you are authorized to borrow overall, based on your age, the interest rate, and the value of your home (or check the calculator above for an estimate). This number is known as your initial principal limit.Generally, you can take out up to 60% of your initial principal limit in the first year. If the amount you owe on an existing mortgage (or other required payments) is more than 60% of this limit, you can take out enough to pay off your mortgage (and any other required payments, including upfront loan fees) plus cash of up to 10% of the initial principal limit. How you receive your money matters.If you choose an adjustable rate line-of-credit or monthly payout, you can access your remaining funds after the first year. But if you choose a fixed-rate, lump-sum loan, you will only be able to access the amount permitted under the first-year withdrawal limits. The remaining loan amount is forfeited. Tip:  Just because you can borrow a large sum does not mean that’s the best choice for you. Talk to a reverse mortgage counselor.

245,Are there other types of loans that can serve a similar purpose as a reverse mortgage loan?,,"It depends on your situation. Depending on your financial situation and your needs, other loans may make more sense than a reverse mortgage. These include second mortgage loans or Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) loans, which may have lower fees – but you will need to be able to make loan payments to a bank or other lender on a regular basis. Some states, local government agencies, and nonprofit organizations also provide single-purpose reverse mortgage loans to help pay for home repairs, improvements, or property taxes.If you could use some help paying property taxes, options may be available.Example: Let’s say your father is having trouble paying his property taxes.

246,My lender offered me a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC). What is a HELOC?,,"A HELOC is a line of credit that allows you to borrow against your home equity. You can borrow over time using special checks or a credit card.For most HELOCs, you can borrow money only for a specified time, starting when you open your account. During this time, known as the “draw period,” you can borrow money and you must make minimum payments. When the draw period ends, you will no longer be able to borrow money from your line of credit.After the draw period ends, under some plans you may be required to pay off your balance immediately in one payment. Under other plans, you will have a certain amount of time to pay down your balance. During this time, known as the “repayment period,” you will not be able to borrow additional amounts and may have to make larger minimum payments than during the draw period.Under some plans, if you make only the minimum payments you will not pay off your entire balance by the end of the term. At that point, you will have to pay the remaining balance as a single lump-sum, known as a “balloon payment.” If you cannot get another loan to repay this amount, or pay it off using your savings, you could lose your home.HELOCs usually have a variable interest rate that changes over time, so your payments may not be the same from month to month.If the value of your home falls significantly, your lender may decide not to allow you to take out additional credit under your HELOC plan which may result in you not having access to as much money as you thought you would. TIP: If you are considering a home equity line of credit, shop around to compare all your options. Just like other mortgages, HELOCs have costs and fees associated with them. Also be sure you review the risks of this line of credit. The best way to avoid problems is not to sign anything you don’t understand. TIP: If you are having trouble with your bills, taking out a HELOC to pay down your debt may cause more trouble for you and put your home at risk. Before taking out a HELOC to consolidate your debts, talk to a U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development-approved housing counselor. A HUD-approved housing counselor can, advise you on managing your money and debts, help you develop a budget, and give you free educational materials or workshops Avoid firms that ask for big fees up-front or that make unrealistic promises – like restoring your credit or repaying your debts for pennies on the dollar.

If you are worried about foreclosure, you should call the CFPB at 1-855-411-CFPB (2372) to be connected with a U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)-approved housing counselor.Typically, once you fall four months behind on your mortgage payments, the foreclosure process may begin (although the process can begin earlier or later). The foreclosure process may proceed in one of three ways depending on your state: judicial sale, which requires that the process go through court; power of sale, which can be carried out entirely by the lender; or strict foreclosure, which is only available in a few states and requires the lender or a servicer acting on the lender’s behalf to file a lawsuit against the borrower. All types of foreclosure generally involve public notice to be given and require all parties to be notified regarding the proceedings. States laws on giving notice and scheduling a foreclosure sale vary. Some states may also provide you with the right to mediation prior to foreclosure. Be sure to read your mail carefully and act promptly on notices you receive. For a list of foreclosure resources by state, please visit the HUD’s website. Military members or veterans can call the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) or visit the VA’s home loan website to get personalized assistance. If you believe you are in need of an attorney, or if you have been served with a notice of foreclosure or other related legal document, you may be able to find legal aid in your state for legal representation available at little or no cost to you.

290,What is a short sale?,,"A short sale is a sale of your home for less than what you owe on your mortgage. A short sale is an alternative to foreclosure, but requires you to leave your home. If your lender or servicer acting on the lender’s behalf agrees to a short sale, you may be able to sell your home to pay off your mortgage, even if the sale price or proceeds turn out to be less than the balance remaining on your mortgage. If you live in a state in which you are responsible for any deficiency between the sale price for your home and the amount you still owe on your mortgage loan, you will want to ask your lender or servicer acting on your lender’s behalf to waive the deficiency before you go through with a short sale. The deficiency is the difference between the amount owed on a loan and the total amount collected from the sale proceeds. In some states, after a short sale, your lender could sue you to collect the amount of the deficiency. Getting a waiver of deficiency means that the lender waived the right to collect this amount. If the lender waives the deficiency, get the waiver in writing and keep it. If you choose this option, a U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)-approved housing counselor can help you plan your next steps.

293,I&#146;m a military servicemember or veteran and am considering buying a home. What should I think about before taking out a mortgage?,,"If you're a veteran or an active duty member of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines or Coast Guard, there are two steps you should take right away when you consider buying a house: 1. Figure out what you can afford The first step is to be sure that you can afford to buy a home and in what price range. Tip: If you're on active duty, make an appointment to see a financial counselor at your local installation’s Personal Financial Management Program (PFMP). You can find the the closest PFMP office online – select “Personal Financial Management Services” in the “Program or Service” drop-down box.  Additional resources that can help you make this complex decision are the U.S. Department of Defense-endorsed site Military One Source and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).  Tip: When deciding how much house you can afford, don’t forget to consider future changes in your income or obligations that might be triggered by children, retirement or transition from the military, or a change in your spouse’s employment status. You should also take into account potential changes in home values, especially if you expect to move. You should also consider how your interest rate and payment could change over time, if you're considering an adjustable rate mortgage (ARM). Keep in mind that the cost of owning a home includes payments for: Homeowner’s insurance Property taxes Utilities Maintenance Repairs that you may not have faced when living in on-base or leased housingChanges in the real estate market are hard to predict, so think carefully about purchasing a home if you expect to be in the area for only three to five years or less. A downturn in the real estate market may make it hard for you to sell, rent or even refinance the home if you are obligated to move away. 2. Check your creditBe sure to check your credit report information to make sure an error won't stop you from getting the best interest rate that you can get. Although a difference of one percent on a mortgage rate may not seem like much, it can add up to tens of thousands of dollars in the long term.  Tip: As a servicemember, you may be able to access not just your credit report but also your credit score for free, along with free financial education and counseling, through the PFMP office. If you are deployed, your first resource is your chain-of-command, who should be able to direct you to the servicing Personal Financial Manager (PFM) in your situation. In isolated cases where you are not provided access to a PFM, your credit report and score may be obtained by contacting the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) Investor Education Foundation by emailing creditscore@finra.org.  Warning: Be wary of credit repair scams that promise to improve your credit score for a fee.

Three business days before closing, your lender provides you with a form called the Closing Disclosure. This form lists all the fees associated with getting the loan and breaks them down into categories to clearly indicate who pays what fee. Page 3 of the Closing Disclosure shows what fees you are responsible for and how much money you need to pay to close on the loan.It’s a good idea to bring your Loan Estimate, Closing Disclosure, and any other loan documents to your Legal Assistance Office for review. If that’s not possible, you may download a pamphlet that explains your fees from the VA’s home loan website. If you still have questions or concerns, call your regional VA office or call the VA main Home Loan information line at 1-877-827-3702 for assistance. Note:  You won’t receive a Loan Estimate or Closing Disclosure if you applied for a mortgage prior to October 3, 2015, or if you're applying for a reverse mortgage. For those loans, you will receive two forms – a Good Faith Estimate (GFE) and an initial Truth-in-Lending disclosure  – instead of a Loan Estimate. Instead of a Closing Disclosure, you will receive a final Truth in Lending disclosure and a HUD -1 Settlement Statement. If you are applying for a HELOC, a manufactured housing loan that is not secured by real estate, or a loan through certain types of homebuyer assistance programs, you will not receive a GFE or a Loan Estimate, but you should receive a Truth-in-Lending disclosure.",/askcfpb/295/I-am-in-the-military-and-Im-in-the-process-of-closing-on-my-first-VA-home-loan-I-hear-that-servicemembers-and-veterans-do-not-have-to-pay-many-of-the-closing-costs-associated-with-a-typical-closing.html,APPROVED,Mortgages,Applying for a mortgage | Closing on a mortgage,Servicemembers,"<Question: 148 I never received a &#147;Good Faith Estimate&#148; or GFE.

296,I am a servicemember or veteran and I have decided to purchase a home. How do I know if a VA loan is the right fit for me?,,"You should consider the advantages and disadvantages of getting a U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)-guaranteed loan. Some of the advantages, once you qualify, include the ability to buy a home with no down payment (as long as the sales price doesn’t exceed the appraised value), as well as the absence of the private mortgage insurance (PMI) requirement. PMI may cost up to one percent of the loan amount each year. The VA loan program also limits the closing costs you may be charged and gives you the right to prepay your mortgage without a penalty. Also, the VA may be able to offer you some assistance if you run into temporary financial difficulties.There may be disadvantages to a VA loan. For example, a VA loan could have a higher interest rate than a conventional loan, although interest rates on VA loans are negotiable. In addition, most borrowers are required to pay a VA loan funding fee (currently between one and three percent of the amount of the loan). Also, opting for a loan without a down payment makes it important that you plan to stay in the home for a while because a drop in home values could quickly put you “upside down” on your mortgage, leaving you owing more than the home is worth. The larger the down payment you are able to make, the more cushion you have to prevent this from happening.

With my local real estate market in a downturn, I know it will be impossible for me to sell and pay off my mortgage. What advice can you give me about renting out my home?",,"First, make sure your loan terms permit you to rent out the home by reviewing your mortgage and note. If you didnt keep a copy of your mortgage and note from the closing, call your mortgage lender and request copies for your review. If you choose to rent out your home, you will need to inform your homeowners insurance company. Often your homeowners insurance rate will increase if the home becomes a rental unit. If you have an escrow account, this could mean an eventual increase in your monthly payment. You should also set up an emergency fund to cover your mortgage and other home-related expenses for periods when you might not receive rental income. As it can be difficult to act as a landlord when you are many miles away, you might want to employ a trusted friend, relative or property management company to help.

Manufactured homes are also eligible for government-insured loans offered by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and the Rural Housing Services (RHS) under the U.S. Department of Agriculture. As with conventional mortgages, there are many factors involved in determining the loan amount you will qualify for under these programs. These factors include:  State laws Whether the home is attached to the land Whether you are also purchasing the land Neighborhood covenants Make sure you consult more than one lender. Don’t take the deal offered by the company selling the home without careful comparison. Also, keep in mind that manufactured home values have been known to drop faster than those for site-built homes. If you receive Permanent Change of Station (PCS) orders, it may be challenging to sell your manufactured home for enough to pay off your debt, even in a favorable real estate market.

306,I am on active duty in the military or have been on active duty within the past year. Am I protected from foreclosure?,,"The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA) provides military personnel and their dependents protections when it comes to issues related to mortgages and housing.If you are on active duty and obtained a mortgage before you went on active duty (also known as a “pre-service mortgage obligation”), you generally cannot be foreclosed on without a valid court order (regardless of whether you told your lender or servicer acting on your lender’s behalf of your active duty status) while you are on active duty, as well as for an additional nine months after leaving active duty.The SCRA provides protection against default judgments (which are rulings against a party to a lawsuit because he or she didn’t appear in court) against a servicemember – including foreclosure cases before a judge – while on active duty. If you rent instead of own your home, the SCRA prevents eviction of servicemembers or their dependents without a court order during a period of military service, as long as your monthly rent is less than $2,975.54 (this is the limit for 2011).If you obtained a mortgage before you went on active duty, the SCRA requires your lender or servicer acting on your lender’s behalf to reduce your mortgage interest rate to 6 percent (including service charges and fees) for the entire time you are on active duty, and for an additional year after you leave active duty. Any interest above the six percent cap is forgiven, not deferred. To receive this interest rate reduction, you must provide your lender or servicer acting on your lender’s behalf with written notice and a copy of the orders calling you to active duty no later than 180 days after you leave military service.If you believe your rights under the SCRA have been violated, you should contact the nearest Armed Forces Legal Assistance Program office.

Usually, if you sell your home for less than you owe on your mortgage, you still must pay the rest of what you owe on the mortgage.Many mortgage servicers treat the receipt of PCS orders as a “qualifying hardship.” This means that you may be able to receive help through certain loss mitigation programs, such as a short sale program, even if you are current on your mortgage payments.For example, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac offer a short sale program for servicemembers with PCS orders. If your loan is owned by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, you purchased your home on or before June 30, 2012, and you successfully sell it through a short sale approved by your servicer, you will not be required to pay back any remaining loan balance. Your loan obligation will be satisfied by the proceeds from the sale. If your loan isn’t owned by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, similar programs still might be available to you.As soon as you receive PCS orders, contact your loan servicer. Tell them you have PCS orders, ask what programs are available, and ask how to apply. Typically, you will need to submit an application, along with a copy of your PCS orders. TIP:  You may have to pay taxes on the debt that the lender forgives as part of the short sale agreement. Contact a tax advisor for more information. We always recommend contacting your local Judge Advocate General’s (JAG), or Personal Financial Manager’s (PFM) office to learn more about your mortgage options.

315,What is a credit score?,A credit score predicts how likely you are to pay back a loan on time. A scoring model uses information from your credit report to create a credit score.,"Companies use a mathematical formula – called a scoring model – to create your credit score from the information in your credit report. Some factors that make up a typical credit score include: Your bill-paying history Your current unpaid debt The number and type of loan accounts you have How long you have had your loan accounts open How much of your available credit you are using New applications for creditWhether you have had a debt sent to collection, a foreclosure, or a bankruptcy, and how long agoCompanies use credit scores to make decisions such as whether to offer you a mortgage, credit card, auto loan, or other credit product. They are also used to determine the interest rate you receive on a loan or credit card, and the credit limit.Keep in mind there is no “one” credit score. It is important to know that you do not have just “one” credit score and there are many credit scores available to you as well as to lenders. Any credit score depends on the data used to calculate it, and may differ depending on the scoring model, the source of your credit history, the type of loan product, and even the day when it was calculated. Usually a higher score makes it easier to qualify for a loan and may result in a better interest rate. Most credit scores range from 300-850.",/askcfpb/315/what-is-a-credit-score.html,APPROVED,Credit reports and scores,Understanding credit reports and scores | What affects credit scores,,<Question: 5 How do I get a copy of my credit reports?> | <Question: 316 Where can I get my credit score?> | <Question: 318 How do I get and keep a good credit score?>,Credit Reporting Complaint
316,Where can I get my credit score?,"There are a few main ways to get your credit score, including from a credit card or other loan statement, a non-profit counselor, or for a fee from a credit reporting agency.","You actually have more than one credit score. Credit scores are calculated based on the information in your credit reports. If the information about you in the credit reports of the three large consumer reporting companies is different, your credit score from each of the companies will be different. Lenders also use slightly different credit scores for different types of loans. There are four main ways to get a credit score:Check your credit card or other loan statement. Many major credit card companies and some auto loan companies have begun to provide credit scores for all their customers on a monthly basis. The score is usually listed on your monthly statement, or can be found by logging in to your account online. Talk to a non-profit counselor. Non-profit credit counselors and HUD-approved housing counselors can often provide you with a free credit report and score and help you review them.Use a credit score service. Many services and websites advertise a “free credit score.” Some sites may be funded through advertising and not charge a fee. Other sites may require that you sign up for a credit monitoring service with a monthly subscription fee in order to get your “free” score. These services are often advertised as “free” trials, but if you don’t cancel within the specified period (often as short as one week), you could be on the hook for a monthly fee. Before you sign up to try one of these services, be sure you know what you are signing up for and how much it really costs.Buy a score. You can buy a score directly from the credit reporting companies. You can buy your FICO credit score at myfico.com. Other services may also offer scores for purchase. If you decide to purchase a credit score, you are not required to purchase credit protection, identity theft monitoring, or other services that may be offered at the same time.Some credit score sources provide an ""educational"" credit score, instead of a score that a lender would use. The CFPB published a report on the differences between educational scores and those used by lenders. For most people, an educational score will be close to the scores lenders use and can be helpful for consumers. But the scores can be quite different for some. Our report found a meaningful difference for one out of four people. When choosing where to get your credit score, find out what kind of score it is. TIPAlways get and review your credit reports, which you can do at no cost to you at www.AnnualCreditReport.com. Your credit scores are calculated based on the information in your credit reports. If there are errors on your credit reports, they can reduce your scores unnecessarily.

One way to make sure your payments are on time is to set up automatic payments, or set up electronic reminders. If you’ve missed payments, get current and stay current.Don’t get close to your credit limit. Credit scoring models look at how close you are to being “maxed out,” so try to keep your balances low compared to your total credit limit. If you close some credit card accounts and put most or all of your credit card balances onto one card, it may hurt your credit score if this means that you are using a high percentage of your total credit limit. Experts advise keeping your use of credit at no more than 30 percent of your total credit limit. You don’t need to revolve on credit cards to get a good score. Paying off the balance each month helps get you the best scores.A long credit history will help your score. Credit scores are based on experience over time. The more experience your credit report shows with paying your loans on time, the more information there is to determine whether you are a good credit recipient.Only apply for credit that you need. Credit scoring formulas look at your recent credit activity as a signal of your need for credit. If you apply for a lot of credit over a short period of time, it may appear to lenders that your economic circumstances have changed negatively. Fact-check your credit reports. If you spot suspected errors, dispute them. If you have old credit card accounts you are not using, keep an eye on them to make sure that an identity thief is not using them. Tip:If you are new to credit, consider getting a product designed to help you establish and build credit.

Your credit score is calculated based on the information in your credit report. Higher scores reflect a better credit history and make you eligible for lower interest rates.You have many different credit scores, and there are many ways to get a credit score. However, most mortgage lenders use FICO scores. Your score can differ depending on which credit reporting agency is used. Most mortgage lenders look at scores from all three major credit reporting agencies – Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion – and use the middle score for deciding what rate to offer you. Errors on your credit report can reduce your score artificially – which could mean a higher interest rate and less money in your pocket – so it is important to check your credit report and correct any errors well before you apply for a loan.Your credit score is only one component of your mortgage lender’s decision, but it’s an important one.  Other factors include: Credit report Credit history with that lender The amount of debt you already have How much you have in savings Your total assets Current income  Tip Don’t apply for a lot of new credit in a short time, especially if you are getting ready to get a mortgage. Doing so may negatively affect your score. Your credit score may decline if you have too many credit accounts. It can also go down if you apply for or open many new accounts in a short time.

For the most common credit scoring models, student loan, auto loan and mortgage-related inquiries that occur 30 days prior to scoring have no effect at all on your credit score.

The federal Fair Credit Reporting Act covers how debt collection is reported in credit reports. In addition, there are state laws that provide protections.","The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA)The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) is the main federal law that governs debt collection practices. The FDCPA prohibits debt collection companies from using abusive, unfair or deceptive practices to collect debts from you. TipIf you're having trouble with a debt collector, you can submit a complaint with the CFPB online or by calling (855) 411-CFPB (2372). You can also report any problems to your state's attorney general. You also may be able to sue a debt collector in state or federal court. The FDCPA covers the collection of: Mortgages Credit cards Medical debtsOther debts mainly for personal, family, or household purposes. The FDCPA does not cover business debts. It also does not generally cover collection by the original creditor to whom you first became indebted.Under the FDCPA, debt collectors include collection agencies, debt buyers, and lawyers who regularly collect debts as part of their business. There are also companies that buy past-due debts from creditors or other businesses and then try to collect them. These debt collectors are also usually called debt collection agencies, debt collection companies, or debt buyers. Restrictions on communications by debt collectors when collecting a debtTime and place. Generally, debt collectors may not contact you at an unusual time or place, or at a time or place they know is inconvenient to you, and they are  prohibited from contacting you before 8 a.m. or after 9 p.m. Also if a debt collector knows that you're not allowed to receive the debt collector’s communications at work, then the debt collector is not allowed to contact you there.Harassment. Debt collectors may not harass you or anyone else, over the phone or through any other form of contact.Representation by attorney. If a debt collector knows that an attorney is representing you about the debt, the debt collector generally must stop contacting you, and must contact the attorney instead. This is only true if the debt collector knows, or can easily find out, the name and contact information of your attorney. If an attorney is representing you and a debt collector calls, tell them which attorney is representing you and that the debt collector should contact the attorney, not you. TipThe CFPB has prepared sample letters that you can use to respond to a debt collector who is trying to collect a debt. Our letters include tips on how to use them. The sample letters may help you to get information, set limits or stop any further communication, or protect some of your rights. Always keep a copy of your letter for your records.If you tell a debt collector in writing to stop contacting you, the debt collector can't contact you again except to: Say there will be no further contactNotify you that the debt collector or the creditor may take certain specific action it is legally allowed to take, such as a lawsuit against youWarning: Telling a debt collector to stop contacting you does not prevent the debt collector from pursuing other legal ways to collect the debt from you if you owe it, including a lawsuit against you or reporting negative information to a credit reporting company. Any debt collector who contacts you claiming you owe payment on a debt is required by law to tell you certain information about the debt. That information includes: The name of the creditor The amount owed That you can dispute the debtThat you can request the name and address of the original creditor, if different from the current creditorIf the debt collector doesn’t provide this information when they first contact you, they are required to send you a written notice including that information within five days of the initial contact.You can dispute all or part of the debt. You can also ask for more information if you are unsure you owe money to a creditor, or how much you might owe. If you dispute all or part of a debt in writing within 30 days of when you receive the required information from the debt collector, the debt collector cannot call or contact you to collect the debt or the disputed part until the debt collector has provided the verification of the debt in writing to you. You can also request that the creditor give you the name and address of the original creditor. If you make that request in writing within 30 days, the debt collector has to stop all debt collection activities until the debt collector provides you that information. If you don’t recognize the name of the creditor, ask if it might have purchased the debt from another company and, if so, what the name of that company is.When you get the requested information or the response to your dispute from the debt collector, see if your own records agree with the information the debt collector provided. The Fair Credit Reporting ActThere are other important federal laws as well. The federal Fair Credit Reporting Act covers how financial matter, including debt collections can be reported in your credit report.  There are also federal consumer financial protection laws that prohibit unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices that apply to debt collectors, as well as creditors. TipPut it in writing. A good practice is to confirm your requests with the debt collector by mailing a written letter. Keep a copy of your letter, showing the date you wrote it, so that you have a record of your request. State lawsMost states have laws about debt collection practices, many of which are similar to the FDCPA. Some of those state laws cover the original creditor, while others don't. States also have Unfair and Deceptive Acts and Practices laws that may apply to debt collection. Contact your state attorney general's office to learn more about the laws in your state.If you're having trouble with debt collection, you can submit a complaint with the CFPB online or by calling (855) 411-CFPB (2372).",/askcfpb/329/are-there-laws-that-limit-what-debt-collectors-can-say-or-do.html,APPROVED,Debt collection,Understanding debt collection | Getting information from a debt collector | Disputing a debt in collection | Harassment by a debt collector,,"<Question: 330 What is a debt collector?> | <Question: 331 What information does a debt collector have to give me about the debt?> | <Question: 335 Can debt collectors call me anytime they want, day or night, about my debt?>",Debt Collection Complaint
330,What is a debt collector?,"Under the federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, in general, a debt collector is a person or a company that regularly collects debts owed to others, usually when those debts are past-due.","Debt collectors include collection agencies or lawyers who collect debts as part of their business. There are also companies that buy past-due debts from creditors or other businesses and then try to collect them. These debt collectors are also called debt collection agencies, debt collection companies, or debt buyers. A debt collector may be trying to contact you because: A creditor believes you are past due on a debt. Creditors may use their own in-house debt collectors or may refer or sell your debt to an outside debt collector.A debt collector also may be calling you to locate someone you know, as long as the collector does not reveal that they are collecting a debt. A debt buyer has bought the debt and is now collecting that debt or is hiring collectorsIf the debt collector is contacting you for payment on a debt and you have concerns about the debt,  the amount they are claiming, or the company contacting you, you might want to speak to an attorney or a credit counseling organization. Before speaking with a debt collector, consider working up a plan. You might be able to set up a payment plan or negotiate with them to resolve the debt. Warning:You can ask a debt collector to stop contacting you. You should do so in writing. Asking them to stop contacting you will not prevent them from suing you or reporting the debt to a credit reporting company. If you do not owe the debt or have already paid the debt, it is important to take action to contest the attempt to collect the debt. TIP: The CFPB has prepared sample letters that you can use to respond to a debt collector who is trying to collect a debt. The letters include tips on how to use them. The sample letters may help you to get information, set limits or stop any further communication, or exercise some of your rights. The creditor or the debt collector also may make a negative report to a consumer reporting company, affecting your credit report and credit scores. In some cases, the debt may be too old to affect your credit report or credit scores. If you don’t believe you owe the debt, you can dispute it with the debt collector and the credit reporting company. If you dispute the debt in writing within 30 days of receiving information about the debt from the collector, then the debt collector must send you verification of the debt. You can also ask the debt collector for additional information.If you're having trouble with debt collection, you can submit a complaint with the CFPB online or by calling (855) 411-CFPB (2372).",/askcfpb/330/what-is-a-debt-collector.html,APPROVED,Debt collection,Understanding debt collection,,<Question: 329 Are there laws that limit what debt collectors can say or do?> | <Question: 331 What information does a debt collector have to give me about the debt?> | <Question: 332 Can debt collectors tell other people about my debt?>,Debt Collection Complaint

If you owe money on more than one debt with a debt collector, you can direct the debt collector to apply any payment you make to the debt you choose.Any debt collector who contacts you claiming you owe payment on one or more debts is required by law to tell you certain information about the debts. That information includes the names of the creditors, the amounts owed, and how you can dispute the debts or seek verification of the debts.  If the debt collector doesn’t provide that information in the initial contact with you, the debt collector is required to send you a written notice including that information within five days of the initial contact.

334,What should I do if a creditor or debt collector sues me?,"If you're sued by a debt collector, you should respond to the lawsuit. You can respond personally or through an attorney, but you must do so by the date specified in the court papers.","When you respond or “answer” the lawsuit, the debt collector will have to prove to the court that the debt is valid and that you owe the debt. Tip:If you are sued, carefully read the lawsuit, and respond by any deadline. If you don’t respond, the court will likely issue a judgment against you as requested in the lawsuit.Warning: While you must be properly “served” with a lawsuit, you won’t be able to stop the lawsuit by refusing to accept delivery or “service” of the lawsuit. By doing these things you’ll essentially be ignoring the lawsuit and you could be considered by the court as being properly served.If you ignore a court action, it's likely that a judgment will be entered against you for the amount the creditor or debt collector claims you owe. Often the court also will award additional fees against you to cover collections costs, interest, and attorney fees.Judgments give debt collectors much stronger tools to collect the debt from you. Depending on your situation and your state’s laws, the creditor may be able to: Garnish your wages Place a lien against your property Move to freeze or garnish all or part of the funds in your bank account Warning: You also may lose the ability to dispute that you owe the debt if a court issues a judgment against you. A judgment is a court order. Only the court can change it. It's very difficult to get a judgment changed or set aside once the case is over. You have a much better chance to fight a collection in court if you defend the case than if you wait until a judgment is entered against you. You may also be able to work out a compromise or settlement by negotiating with the debt collector before a court makes a judgment. Tip: Consult an attorney in your state to learn more about your rights if you are sued on a debt.Some attorneys may also offer free services, or charge a reduced fee, such as through your local bar association. You may wish to find an attorney who has experience in the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and debt collection issues. There may also be legal aid offices or legal clinics in your area who will offer their services for free if you meet their criteria.

405,What happens if my payroll card is lost or stolen?,"You should contact your card issuer immediately if your government benefit or payroll card is lost or stolen, or you see unauthorized charges. The sooner you report a lost card or unauthorized charges, the more protections you will have.","If you lost your card or PIN:If you notify your card issuer within two business days of realizing that your card is lost or stolen, you can only be held responsible for up to $50 of any unauthorized transfers that occurred before you contacted your financial institution. If you wait longer than two days, you could be liable for up to $500 of unauthorized transfers that occurred before you gave notice. Make sure to report unauthorized transactions within 60 days of the issuer sending you the statement or account history showing an unauthorized transaction (or, for payroll cards only, within 60 days of accessing your account history online that shows the unauthorized transaction). If you wait longer, you could lose the full amount of any transactions that occurred after the 60-day period. If you didn’t lose your card:If an unauthorized transaction shows up on your account, but you did not lose your card, security code, or PIN or have any of them stolen, you should still notify your card provider right away. Under federal law, you will not be liable for the transaction if you report it within 60 days after the card issuer sends you a statement or account history that shows the unauthorized transaction (or, for payroll cards only, after you access your account history online that shows the unauthorized transaction). If the charge goes unreported for more than 60 days, your money could be lost. WARNING:These federal protections for unauthorized transactions do not apply to certain prepaid benefit cards that state agencies use to distribute “needs tested” or “needs based” benefits. Examples of these needs-tested benefits include Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or TANF, and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.

What does the card issuer have to do once I report it? Can I get my money back?Once you notify your card issuer, they generally have ten business days to investigate the claim, or 20 business days if the account has been open less than 30 days. Your card issuer then has three business days to report their findings to you. If the card issuer can’t complete its investigation within the required 10 or 20 business days, the issuer it must credit your account for the full disputed amount minus a maximum of $50 while the investigation continues.The issuer may require you to provide written confirmation of the error if you initially provided the information in a phone conversation. If you are asked to follow up in writing and you do not do so within ten business days, the issuer is not required to temporarily credit your account during the course of its investigation.Generally, the issuer must resolve the issue in 45 days. There are different times if the disputed transactions were made in a foreign country, were conducted within 30 days of account opening, or were debit card point-of-sale purchases. In those cases, you may have to wait as long as 90 days for the issue to be fully resolved.Once the card issuer confirms an unauthorized charge, they must correct the error within one business day.If the issuer determines that no error occurred, they can take back the money that they credited to you during the investigation.

For example, you may have a certain number of free ATM withdrawals every month or you may not be charged an ATM fee if you use ATMs that are in a particular network.In general, federal government benefit cards and some state government benefit cards have certain legal protections under federal law. These protections include limitations on liability for fraudulent or unauthorized charges, error resolution procedures, and requirements that consumers have access to their account information.

Federal student loans allow you to limit the amount you must repay each month based on your income.For borrowers pursuing careers in public service, loan forgiveness on federal student loans may be available after 10 years.Federal student loans also feature other important borrower protections, including: Options to delay or temporarily forgo payments (like deferment and forbearance) Discharge upon a borrower’s death Discharge upon permanent disability (with certain limitations) But the consequences for defaulting on a federal student loan are pretty serious: Your wages may be garnished without a court order; and You can lose out on your tax refund or Social Security check (funds would be applied toward your defaulted student loan).Private student loans are any student loans that are not federal student loans. These loans do not offer the flexible repayment terms or borrower protections featured by federal student loans. Private student loans are not funded or subsidized by the federal government;  instead, they are funded by banks, credit unions, or other types of lenders.The bank or lender – not the federal government – sets interest rates, loan limits, terms, and conditions of private student loans. Your ability to qualify for and borrow a private student loan may be based on numerous factors that can include your credit history, whether or not you choose to have a co-signer, your co-signer’s credit history, your choice of school, and your course of study.While private student loans are all structured differently, they are generally different from federal student loans in several ways and may include: Variable interest rates that can rise when interest rates rise during the life of the loan — which can substantially increase your payment Fewer options to reduce or postpone paymentsLess flexible repayment options",/askcfpb/545/what-are-main-differences-between-federal-student-loans-and-private-student-loans.html,APPROVED,Student loans,Understanding student loans,,<Question: 559 What are private or alternative education loans?> | <Question: 561 What are private consolidation loans?> | <Question: 567 Should I choose federal student loans or private student loans?>,Student Loan Complaint
547,What should I consider when deciding how much to borrow? ,,"You should borrow only what your future earnings will allow you to repay. In general, try not to borrow more for all four (or more years) of college than you expect to earn as a starting annual salary when you leave school.If your total student loan debt when you graduate were equal to your starting annual salary, at the current interest rate for federal student loans, your payment would be nearly 14 percent of your gross monthly income.  Contact your local library or your college’s career center to find resources to determine the salary you might be able to expect when graduating in your field.  Tip:Don’t borrow the maximum just because you are able to obtain the loans. Borrow just enough to make sure your tuition, housing, and other expenses are fully paid after accounting for work earnings and any other sources of income. Tip: Don’t replace student loan debt with credit card debt. This will be a much more expensive way to finance your education. Credit cards do not provide the flexible repayment terms or borrower protections offered by federal student loans. Tip:As you continue to borrow additional student loans each year you are in school, you should keep track of your total student debt. The definitive source for your current loan balances of all of your federal student loans is the National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS). Your college financial aid office or your lender will have more information about your private student loan balances.Of course, you should consider many other factors specific to your individual circumstances when determining how much debt you can handle. This is a personal decision that only you can make.

549,What is a Stafford loan?,Stafford loans are a type of federal student loan that are either subsidized – the government pays the interest while you're in school – or unsubsidized – you pay all the interest.,"Stafford loans are either subsidized – the government pays the interest while you're in school – or unsubsidized – you pay all the interest, although most students will not start making these payments until after graduation. Unsubsidized Stafford loans add the accrued interest to the loan balance, increasing the size and ultimate cost of the loan.Both subsidized and unsubsidized Stafford loans require the completion of the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). To receive a subsidized Stafford loan, you must be able to demonstrate financial need. All students, regardless of need, are eligible for the unsubsidized Stafford loan. As of July 1, 2012, graduate and professional students are eligible only for unsubsidized Stafford loans. Repayment on all Stafford loans typically begins six months after you graduate or drop below half-time enrollment. The standard repayment term is 10 years from the date of your first payment, but alternative repayment terms are available. You may want to investigate alternative repayment plans if you have trouble making your payment, or if you want to have lower monthly payments over a longer period of time. Annual and lifetime Stafford loan limits vary widely by the status of the student (dependent versus independent) and the year of schooling (freshman versus graduate or medical student). The U.S. Department of Education’s Federal Student Aid website has the most up-to-date information on Stafford loan limits. Stafford Loans are made under the Federal Direct Loan Program (FDLP). Before July 2010, they were also made under the Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP), though no new FFELP loans are being made now.",/askcfpb/549/what-stafford-loan.html,APPROVED,Student loans,Understanding student loans,,<Question: 545 What are the main differences between federal student loans and private student loans?> | <Question: 551 What is a Perkins loan?> | <Question: 553 What is a PLUS loan? >,Student Loan Complaint

553,What is a PLUS loan? ,There are two types of PLUS loans: the Parent PLUS loan and the Grad PLUS loan. All PLUS loans have a fixed interest rate and are not subsidized.,"All PLUS loans have a fixed interest rate and are not subsidized, which means that interest accrues while enrolled in school. The Parent PLUS loan allows parents of dependent students to borrow money to cover any costs not already covered by the student's financial aid package, up to the full cost of attendance. The program does not set a cumulative limit to how much parents may borrow, and Parent PLUS loans are the financial responsibility of the parents, not the student. Grad PLUS loans allow graduate and professional students to borrow money to pay for their own education. Parent PLUS repayment begins 60 days after the funds are fully disbursed with up to 10 years to repay. Parents have the option of deferring repayment on Parent PLUS loans while the undergraduate student on whose behalf they borrowed the PLUS loan is in school, but they must begin repayment once the student graduates or drops below full-time enrollment.Graduate students may defer repayment on Grad PLUS loans while they are in school, but they also must begin repayment once they graduate or drop below full-time enrollment.",/askcfpb/553/what-plus-loan.html,APPROVED,Student loans,Understanding student loans,Students,<Question: 545 What are the main differences between federal student loans and private student loans?> | <Question: 549 What is a Stafford loan?> | <Question: 551 What is a Perkins loan?>,Student Loan Complaint

Consolidation loans are available for most federal loans. Consolidation loans provide access to several alternative repayment plans besides the 10-year repayment that is standard for federal loans. The most popular options include extended repayment, graduated repayment, and income-based repayment. Choosing to extend your repayment with your consolidation loan can reduce the size of your monthly payment. The reduced monthly payment may make the loan easier to repay for some borrowers. However, by extending the term of a loan, you will pay more in interest over the lifetime of the loan. TIP:If you are having trouble repaying your loans, you should contact your servicer about Income-Based Repayment (IBR) before you enroll in an alternative payment plan that spreads your payments out over a greater period of time. Loans in the Income-Based Repayment program are eligible for loan forgiveness after 25 years and may be eligible for forgiveness after 10 years if you work in public service.",/askcfpb/555/what-does-it-mean-consolidate-my-federal-student-loans.html,APPROVED,Student loans,Repaying a student loan | Consolidating or refinancing a loan,Students,<Question: 3 When can a card issuer look at my credit report?> | <Question: 545 What are the main differences between federal student loans and private student loans?> | <Question: 603 Should I consolidate my federal loans?>,Student Loan Complaint

Federal student loans usually carry more flexible protection if you run into difficulty in repaying your loans, and all new federal student loans have fixed interest rates, meaning the rate does not change over the life of your loan. Private student loans generally have variable interest rates, which can reset every month or quarter, causing your monthly payments to change.However, there are rare cases where a private loan could be a viable alternative to a Federal Grad PLUS loan. This may occur if you: Are a graduate or professional school student with a high certainty of job placement Have a very high credit score Can borrow at interest rates substantially lower than 6.41 percent Are completely committed to finishing the degree program on time Have a specific plan to repay your loans within a few years of graduation (rather than repaying over 10 or more years, increasing the risk  of the rate increasing) Have already borrowed as much as you can under the Direct and Perkins Loan programsIf you have ALL of the above characteristics, you may want to consider private student loan options instead of Federal Direct Grad PLUS loans. A private loan may be better for a student with ALL of these characteristics for a number of reasons: a private loan may have a lower initial interest rate; as a graduate or professional student, you may be more certain of your job prospects and earning potential; and rate changes may have less impact if you expect to quickly repay the loan.Every student’s situation is different.

For each additional year that you are in school and take out student loans, your total debt will continue to increase.You should borrow only what your future earnings will allow you to repay. As a rough estimate, try not to accumulate more total student debt than you expect to earn as a starting annual salary when you leave school.If your total student loan debt when you graduate were equal to your starting annual salary, at a current interest rate for federal student loans, your payment would be nearly 14 percent of your gross monthly income.  Contact your college’s career center to find resources to determine the salary you might be able to expect when graduating in your field.  Tip:Don’t borrow the maximum just because you are able to obtain the loans. Borrow just enough to make sure your tuition, housing, and other expenses are fully paid after accounting for work earnings and any other sources of income.

You should know that you are never penalized for making federal student loan payments before you are required to start paying. Making early payments will reduce the total balance of your loans when required payments begin. This can lead to substantial savings in interest costs over time. Make sure if you make an additional payment that you inform your loan servicer that you would like this payment to be applied to your loan principal – the amount of money that you currently owe on your loan. Warning:Sometimes when you pay more than your monthly payment, your lender will “credit” the amount against a future payment rather than apply it toward your loan balance. For example, say you had a loan with a monthly payment of $115, and one month you decide to pay $300. If your lender is crediting your payments forward, the next month you would get a statement that showed no payment due; you would get your next actual bill the month after.Even though you don’t have a payment due, you should continue making payments each month if you can afford it.

Private student lenders may offer an interest rate reduction for creditworthy borrowers seeking to consolidate their private student loans. This can save you money over the lifetime of your loan.Just like private education loans, private consolidation loans often have variable interest rates – meaning your interest rate can change over the life of the loan – the interest rate you are offered depends on your credit score.

If you don’t pay the interest as it accumulates, it will be added to your loan balance, and the amount you have to pay in the future will be higher. You have to apply for a deferment with your loan servicer, and you must continue to make payments until you’ve been notified your deferment has been granted.Private student loans may or may not have a deferment option, and the rules vary among lenders.

You can receive forbearance if you’re not eligible for a deferment. With forbearance, you will eventually owe the new interest charges even if you’re not making payments. Unlike deferment, with forbearance interest accrues whether your loans are subsidized or unsubsidized, and you’re responsible for repaying it even while in forbearance. Your loan holder can grant forbearance in intervals of up to 12 months at a time for up to three years. You have to apply to your loan servicer for forbearance, and you must continue to make payments until you've been notified your forbearance has been granted.These rules apply to federal student loans.

633,What is Income-Based Repayment (IBR)?,"Income-Based Repayment , or IBR, is a federal student loan repayment program that allows you to limit the amount you must repay each month based on your income and family size.","Many borrowers with federal Direct Loans can now enroll in IBR online.You get a lower payment with IBR if your federal student loan debt is high relative to your income and family size. While your loan servicer will perform the calculation to determine your eligibility, you can use the U.S. Department of Education's IBR calculator to estimate whether you would likely benefit from the IBR plan.The IBR calculator looks at your income, family size, and state of residence to calculate your IBR monthly payment amount. If that amount is lower than the monthly payment you would be paying under the standard 10-year repayment plan, then you are eligible to repay your loans under IBR.IBR has two key advantages, compared to other repayment plans. First, loans are forgiven after you repay for 25 years (or, in some cases, 20 years), even if your loan is not completely paid off. Second, if you have a subsidized loan and your monthly IBR payment is less than the interest that accrues, the government will pay the difference for the first three years that you are repaying through the IBR program, which means your overall balance won’t increase. Your monthly payment adjusts annually and you must submit documentation to remain in the IBR program.

If you extend the term of your loan, you will pay substantially more interest over time, but your payments will be significantly smaller. Remember, you can always add more to your payment than what is required, and you should if you can afford to do so, because it will reduce the total interest you pay over the life of the loan.There are some restrictions with the extended term, so contact your servicer for more details about converting to the extended plan.

641,What is Public Service Loan Forgiveness?,Public Service Loan Forgiveness is a program designed to help you manage your student loan debt while pursuing a career in public service.,"There are a number of programs designed to help you manage your student loan debt while pursuing a career in public service.  We estimate that 25 percent of the U.S. workforce is employed by a public service employer and many may be eligible for existing student loan repayment benefits, including Public Service Loan Forgiveness. We’re asking public service organizations to take a pledge to help tackle student debt. Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) is available to many employees working in public service and at all levels of government—states and municipalities, school districts, public hospitals, non-profit organizations, and more. Understanding the various programs and how they best work together will help you get the largest possible benefit Step 1: Understand your optionsFor most public service employees, enrolling in the Income-Based Repayment (IBR) plan will ensure maximum savings. If you have federal student loans and can show partial economic hardship, you can cap your monthly payment at a percentage of your discretionary income through IBR. IBR is a great way to keep your monthly payments low while continuing to make progress toward the 120 on-time qualifying payments  needed for Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF).Only federal Direct Loans are eligible for PSLF. However, if you have other federal loans originated under the Federal Family Educational Loan (FFEL) program or the Perkins loan program, you may be able to consolidate those loans into a new Direct Loan to qualify. You can learn out more about what type of loan you have through the National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS), available at www.nslds.ed.gov. Tip: If you have a Perkins loan you may have access to other benefits and consolidating your loans may jeopardize your eligibility. Step 2: Enroll and certifyOnce you know which programs are best for you, early enrollment is critical to achieve maximum savings. In order to benefit from the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program you must:Enroll in a qualifying payment plan. Generally, payments at or above the 10-year standard repayment plan qualify for PSLF, but you will likely pay off your entire loan before you are eligible for forgiveness under the standard plan. Reduced monthly payments made under IBR qualify for PSLF and will maximize savings. To get started on IBR, contact your servicer or enroll online. Certify that you work for a qualified public service employer. Use the Employment Certification for Public Service Loan Forgiveness form to keep track of your eligible employment and qualifying loan payments.You will need your employer’s help to complete the certification form. Complete sections one and two on your own, then ask your employer to complete and sign section three before you submit the form. Some employers may already have an established process for submitting this form. You should check with your employer for more information. Step 3: Follow up with your servicerAfter the form is complete, submit it to your servicer and be sure to follow up. It is likely that the organization servicing your loan will change. Each year, you should resubmit the Employment Certification for Public Service Loan Forgiveness form so that you can keep track of your qualifying payments and make sure you stay on the road toward loan forgiveness.",/askcfpb/641/what-public-service-loan-forgiveness.html,APPROVED,Student loans,Cancelling a loan,Students,<Question: 601 Are there any student loan breaks for public service?> | <Question: 633 What is Income-Based Repayment (IBR)?> | <Question: 635 What is graduated repayment?>,Student Loan Complaint

655,What are my options when dealing with a debt collection agency working for the U.S. Department of Education?,"Generally speaking, you have three options when dealing with the collector of a federal student loan: rehabilitation, repayment, or consolidation. Learn more below.","Rehabilitation. Rehabilitation means that your loan will be taken out of default status after you make a series of consecutive (generally, nine) on-time, reasonable, and affordable payments. You can typically only rehabilitate a loan once.This is the only way to remove the default notation from your credit history. If you chose to go back to school, you'll be eligible for federal student aid again after you make the sixth of nine monthly payments.Repayment. If you can afford to pay off your defaulted federal loan, this is the fastest way to settle your debt. Under certain circumstances, your debt collector may be authorized to waive some of your outstanding fees and other collection costs. For some borrowers, this can be the cheapest way to bring a federal student loan out of default. Tip: Visit the CFPB's Paying for College tool for more information on repaying your student loans.Even after you've repaid, the debt will continue to appear on your credit report as a defaulted loan that was repaid. You'll also be eligible for federal student aid again, if you chose to go back to school.Consolidation. Through consolidation, your defaulted loans are paid off by a new loan with new repayment terms. If you can't afford to repay your loan in full, consolidation is the fastest way to get out of default and enroll in one of the U.S. Department of Education’s alternative payment plans. If you can't afford to pay off your loan in full, it's also the fastest way to get out of default and be eligible for federal student aid again. Warning: Consolidation will not undo the negative effect on your credit report caused by your default.When speaking with a collector, be sure that you have written documentation about what federal student debt you owe. If you're concerned that you never borrowed these loans, check the National Student Loan Data System. If the loan does not appear there, contact the collector and inform it of the problem. Remember, that system shows only your federal student loans, not your private student loans. Tip:The CFPB prepared sample letters that you can use to respond to a debt collector who is trying to collect a debt along with tips on how to use them. The sample letters may help you to get information, set ground rules about any further communication, or protect some of your rights.Remember that you have rights when dealing with debt collectors, and it is against the law for a collector to harass you or make false statements to you.

You can submit your request anytime during your active duty service and up to 180 days after leaving service.For borrowers with federal student loans Income-Based Repayment (IBR) is one of the best options to staying on the road of repayment.

The higher the APR, the more you’ll pay over the life of the loan.An auto loan’s interest rate and APR are two of the most important measures of the price you pay for borrowing money. The federal Truth in Lending Act (TILA) requires lenders to give you specific disclosures about important terms, including the APR, before you are legally obligated on the loan. Since all lenders must provide the APR, you can use the APR to compare auto loans. Just make sure that you are comparing APRs to APRs and not to interest rates. The two terms are not the same.

At the F&I; department, you may be asked if you want to buy optional add-ons like an extended warranty, auto service contract, credit insurance, or guaranteed asset protection (GAP) insurance. Before deciding to buy any of these products, think about your needs and the costs. If you finance optional add-ons as part of your loan, this will increase your loan amount. You will pay more interest on the loan since you will be borrowing more money over the life of the loan. Remember, the dealer is not the only seller of most of these products.

749,What is negative equity?,,"If you owe more on your current auto loan than the vehicle is worth—referred to as being “upside down”—then you have negative equity. In other words, if you tried to sell your vehicle, you wouldn’t be able to get  what you already owe on it. For example, say you owe $10,000 on your auto loan and your vehicle is now worth $8,000. That means you have negative equity of $2,000. That negative equity will need to be paid off if you want to trade-in your vehicle and take out an auto loan to purchase a new vehicle.Understanding how negative equity works can help you make a better informed choice about a new auto loan. The longer your auto loan, the more likely you are to have negative equity for a longer period of time. On a longer term loan, you might later still owe money on a vehicle that has outlived its useful life or that you want to sell or trade-in. If you want to roll the balance of your existing auto loan into a new auto loan, this could make the new auto loan much more expensive. Additionally, you will be borrowing more than the price of your new vehicle which will make your total loan cost higher and increase your risk of negative equity in the new vehicle.  TIP:If you do roll the balance of the old loan into a new loan for a new vehicle, ask questions.  Make sure that you understand the total cost of the new loan.  You need to know the amount borrowed, the APR and interest rate, the loan term (in months), and the monthly payment – before you agree to anything. If your new loan does not cover the amount you still owe on your old vehicle then you could have two loans and two monthly payments to make. If your new loan does cover what you still owe on your old vehicle, you could be borrowing a lot more than the price of the new vehicle. Either way, you may want to carefully consider whether it makes sense to go through with the transaction and purchase the next vehicle if you still owe money on your trade-in.",/askcfpb/749/what-negative-equity.html,APPROVED,Auto loans,Understanding auto loans,,<Question: 751 I'm thinking of buying or leasing a car.

751,I'm thinking of buying or leasing a car. How can I decide how much I can afford to borrow?,,"Figuring out how much you can afford to borrow before you sign on the dotted line is a great way to stay in control of your finances. It can be very helpful to break the process down into several steps. For example: 1. Assess your financial situation by creating a monthly budget. Here is a budget worksheet and some information on making a budget. You can use this information as you think through how much you can afford to borrow for an automobile. If you’re not sure how to do this, seek help from a non-profit credit counselor.First, add up all of your fixed expenses (these include: rent/mortgage, utilities, phone and other recurring monthly bills, amounts you set aside for each month for savings, child support payments, insurance premiums, and payments on any existing loans including outstanding credit card debt).Second, add up your estimated additional expenses – for food, gas, entertainment, emergencies and unexpected expenses, and whatever else is not a set monthly expense.Third, if you didn’t have a vehicle before, don’t forget you’ll also have to pay for insurance, maintenance, and registration. Shop around for auto insurance before you shop for a vehicle, to get a sense of how that will affect your budget. If you are going from a used vehicle to a new vehicle, your insurance rates may be higher.Fourth, if you will be trading in a vehicle but still owe money on it, be sure to find out how much you owe on that loan. If what you owe is more than the trade-in or private sale amount, you will need to account for how you will pay that amount. Your loan amount, monthly payment, and total interest cost will be higher if this old debt is rolled into the loan for your new vehicle.Now, subtract all expenses from your take-home pay and any other income you receive on a regular monthly basis. Your auto loan payment should be less than the amount you have left. 2. Review your credit.One of the first things you should do before applying for an auto loan is review your credit report at all of the largest consumer reporting agencies – Equifax, TransUnion, and Experian. You are entitled to a free copy of your credit report from each of these agencies every 12 months, and you can request the free report at www.annualcreditreport.com or by calling 877-322-8228. Review your credit report and dispute any errors that you find. A negative error on your credit report could affect the interest rate you get for an auto loan and cost you hundreds or thousands of dollars.Any negative information on your credit report (such as late payments, delinquencies, court judgments and settlements, or bankruptcy filings) will influence your ability to obtain a loan or to obtain one at a low interest rate. TIP:Most accurate negative information on your credit report must be removed after seven years and bankruptcy information after ten years. If you find a negative item on your report that should have been removed, you should dispute the error on your credit report. 3. Save for a down payment.It’s important to know how much of a down payment you can afford before you call around for loan quotes or go to a dealer. This will help you decide the size of the loan you can afford. Remember the more you put on a down payment, the less you will need to borrow. 4. Research loan options and consider getting prequalified or preapproved for a loan.It’s a good idea to shop around for a loan before heading to a dealer. You may want to consider getting prequalified or preapproved for an auto loan from a bank, credit union, or other lender before visiting an auto dealer.Shopping for the best deal on an auto loan will generally have little to no impact on your credit score(s). The benefit of shopping will far outweigh any impact on your credit. In some cases, applying for multiple loans over a long period of time can lower your credit score(s). Depending on the credit scoring model used, generally any requests or inquiries by these lenders for your credit score(s) that took place within a time span ranging from 14 days to 45 days will only count as a single inquiry. This means shopping around for an auto loan during that time span will count the same as applying for just one loan. You can minimize any negative impact on your credit score by doing all your rate shopping in a short amount of time.When you are offered different loans, compare all of the loan terms. You will look at: The amount you will borrow; The interest rate and the Annual Percentage Rate (APR); The length or term of the loan (number of months); The monthly payment (and whether you’ll be able to make that payment given your budget) A higher interest rate or a longer loan term will result in additional interest costs for your loan. Tip:Don’t forget to read the fine print of any loan contract before you sign. Check to see if your loan has a “prepayment penalty,” which means that you will have to pay a penalty if you pay off your loan before the end of the loan term. Even if you’re not planning to pay off your loan before the end of the term, you may want to avoid loans that have a prepayment penalty in case your situation changes. Check the amount you are borrowing to be sure it is the amount you expected. Check that you are getting the amount of credit you agreed on for your trade-in.",/askcfpb/751/im-thinking-buying-or-leasing-car-how-can-i-decide-how-much-i-can-afford-borrow.html,APPROVED,Auto loans,Understanding auto loans,,"<Question: 753 I've figured out how much I can afford and reviewed my credit report.

753,I've figured out how much I can afford and reviewed my credit report. I've heard about a lot of different auto loan offers but some have lower monthly payments and some are for a longer amount of time. How can I compare?,,"When comparing auto loan offers to determine the best deal, focus on the annual percentage rate (APR), the interest rate and the length of the loan—and not just the monthly payment. If you don’t get the best deal available to you on the interest rate, you could end up paying significant additional interest amounts over the life of the loan.The length of the loan term is also important in considering the overall cost of the loan. A longer loan term may mean smaller monthly payments, but you will pay more in interest over the life of the loan. You should consider carefully whether you want to lengthen the loan term just to get your monthly payments down. Making your loan term longer may not be worth the extra costs and you could be left with a vehicle that’s worth less than what you owe. So don’t focus on the monthly payment alone. The big picture is the total cost of the loan. The total cost of your auto loan depends on the cost of borrowing (interest rate and APR), which is reflected in your monthly payment and in how many months you will have to make that monthly payment (the loan term). In other words, how much you will pay overall depends partly on how long you will have to pay.Understanding the parts of a loan—the amount the loan, the interest rate and the length of the loan—is necessary in order to negotiate the best auto loan for you. Negotiating the interest rate and the loan term are key factors in getting the best auto loan. You might want to use a loan calculator to help you with the math. There are a number of auto loan calculators available online. For example, Consumer Reports and the NADA Guides provide online auto loan calculators that may be helpful in evaluating and comparing the costs and terms of various auto loans. Below is a sample comparison to illustrate how you will pay less in the long run if you have a shorter loan term. The table below assumes a $20,000 loan and an interest rate of 4.75%. Loan Term Monthly Payment Total Interest Paid 36 months (3 years) $597 $1,498 48 months (4 years) $458 $1,999 60 months (5 years) $375 $2,508 72 months (6 years) $320 $3,024While the longer loan term gives you a lower monthly payment, consider the total cost over the term of the loan. If you paid off a $20,000 loan in 3 years, you will pay $1,498 in interest. For a 6 year loan, you will pay $3,024 in interest—more than twice as much. Some financial advisers recommend keeping the length of your auto loan to 5 years or less, reasoning that the longer the loan, the more likely you will owe more than the vehicle is worth.When you think about your auto loan, it is also important to think about the total cost of ownership for your new vehicle. Consider the costs that are higher for a new vehicle than for an older one (such as taxes and insurance) and other costs resulting from the purchase (such as annual registration fees). Maintenance and repairs may also factor into your calculations.",/askcfpb/753/ive-figured-out-how-much-i-can-afford-and-reviewed-my-credit-report-ive-heard-about-lot-different-auto-loan-offers-some-have-lower-monthly-payments-and-some-are-longer-amount-time-how-can-i-compare.html,APPROVED,Auto loans,"Applying, shopping and negotiating",,"<Question: 751 I'm thinking of buying or leasing a car.

Generally a longer loan term will cost more in interest;How much of a down payment can you afford? The larger the down payment, the lower the total cost of the loan; Do you have a trade-in?

With a fixed rate, you can see your payment for each month and the total you will pay over the life of a loan. You might prefer fixed rates if you are looking for a loan payment that won’t change.Variable-rate financing is where the interest rate on your loan can change, based on the prime rate or another rate called an “index.” With a variable-rate loan, the interest rate on the loan changes as the index rate changes, meaning that it could go up or down. Because your interest rate can go up, your monthly payment can also go up. The longer the term of the loan, the more risky a variable rate loan can be for a borrower, because there is more time for rates to increase.",/askcfpb/757/what-difference-between-fixed-and-variable-rate-financing.html,APPROVED,Auto loans,Understanding auto loans,,<Question: 100 What is the difference between a fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) loan? > | <Question: 759 What is the difference between dealer-arranged and bank financing?> | <Question: 761 Where can I get information on auto loan rates?>,Auto Loan Complaint
759,What is the difference between dealer-arranged and bank financing?,,"With bank or other lender financing, you go directly to a bank, credit union, or other lender, and apply for a loan. These lenders can “preapprove” you.  If they are willing to make an auto loan to you, the lender will quote you  an interest rate, loan term (number of months), and maximum loan amount based on factors such as your credit score(s), the terms of the transaction, and the type of vehicle. This lender will then give you a quote or a conditional commitment letter before you go to the dealership. The bank, credit union or other lender offers certain terms, and those terms are negotiable.With dealer-arranged financing, the dealer collects information from you and forwards that information to one or more prospective auto lenders. If the lender(s) chooses to finance your loan, they may authorize or quote an interest rate to the dealer to finance the loan, referred to as the “buy rate.” The interest rate that you negotiate with the dealer may be higher than the “buy rate” because it may include an amount that compensates the dealer for handling the financing.  Dealers may have discretion to charge you more than the buy rate they receive from a lender, so you may be able to negotiate the interest rate the dealer quotes to you. Ask or negotiate for a loan with better terms. Be sure to compare the financing offered through the dealership with the rate and terms of any pre-approval you received from a bank, credit union, or other lender. Choose the option that best fits your budget. After the auto purchase is finalized, the dealer-arranged loan may then be sold to the lender, who has already indicated a willingness to extend the credit.  That lender may own your loan and collect the monthly payments, or transfer those responsibilities and rights to other companies.Some types of dealerships finance auto loans “in-house” to borrowers with no credit or poor credit. At “Buy Here Pay Here” dealerships, you might see signs with messages like “No Credit, No Problem!” The interest rate on loans from these dealerships can be much higher than loans from a bank, credit union, or other type of lender. You may want to consider whether the cost of the loan outweighs the benefit of buying the vehicle. Even if you have poor or no credit, it may be worth it to see if there is a bank, credit union, or another dealer that is willing to make a loan to you. Another feature of this type of dealership is that your monthly payment is to the dealership. Some Buy Here Pay Here Dealerships, and some other lenders that lend to people with no credit or poor credit put devices in their vehicles that help them repossess or disable the vehicle if you miss a payment. TIP:In general, dealers and lenders are not required to offer the best rates available and you can typically negotiate the offered rate.

767,What is risk-based pricing?,,"Risk-based pricing occurs when lenders offer different consumers different interest rates or other loan terms, based on the estimated risk that the consumers will fail to pay back their loans.This means, for example, that lenders will generally offer a higher interest rate to you if they view you as a higher risk borrower - say, because you recently declared bankruptcy, lost a job, or are several payments behind on a mortgage. For the same exact loan, lenders will generally offer a lower interest rate if they view you as a lower risk - say, because you have a good credit score and are employed.Each lender uses its own process to determine the risk that you will default on a loan, but most use your credit score, employment status, income, and other outstanding debts, among other factors.If a lender relied on a credit report in making a lending decision about you, you should get a Risk-Based Pricing notice if you receive less favorable terms than other borrowers based in any part on your credit report. This notice includes information about how to get your free annual credit report, your credit score, the score range, and the negative factors affecting the score.Lenders may NOT use certain legally prohibited factors to decide whether to give you a loan or how much to charge you, such as your race, gender or age.",/askcfpb/767/what-risk-based-pricing.html,APPROVED,Auto loans,Understanding auto loans,,<Question: 309 What is a credit report?> | <Question: 310 Who has a credit report?> | <Question: 719 What should I do if I think an auto dealer or lender is violating the law?>,Auto Loan Complaint
769,What is a loan-to-value ratio? How is it calculated? How does that impact my financing?,,"A loan-to-value ratio (LTV) is the total dollar value of your loan divided by the actual cash value (ACV) of your vehicle. It is usually expressed as a percentage. Your down payment reduces the loan to value ratio of your loan. Your loan terms may be affected by the loan-to-value ratio, because the vehicle is the collateral for the loan, which means that if you default on your loan, the lender can take the vehicle. The lender may seek a down payment to reduce the size of the loan and make it less likely that the amount you owe on the loan will be more than the vehicle is worth.Your vehicle’s actual value is often lower than what you paid, especially immediately after you purchase a new vehicle. The value of a new vehicle typically goes down sharply when you drive off the lot, and then declines more slowly as you continue to use it.

In an amortizing loan, for each of your monthly payments, a portion is applied towards the amount of the loan – the principal – and a portion of the payment is applied towards paying the finance charge – the interest.A greater percentage of your monthly payment is applied to interest early in the life of the loan, and a greater percentage is applied to the principal at the end.

You can look up the approximate value using online commercial websites such as the Consumer Reports, Edmunds, Kelley Blue Book, NADA Guides and online classifieds. These resources may be available at your local library. Finding examples of similar vehicles that have sold recently in your area will help you know a fair price.Once you know how much your current vehicle is worth, you can decide whether to trade it in or sell it yourself. If you trade it in at a dealership, you and the dealer will decide on the value that will be credited towards the purchase price of your next vehicle. If you sell it yourself, you can use the money you get as a down payment.If you still owe money on a vehicle that you want to trade in, there is more to consider.

779,I owe more on my current loan than my current vehicle is worth. Can I still get a new car?,,"If you are considering rolling the balance of the old auto loan into your new auto loan, make sure you understand how this will affect the total cost of your new loan. Carefully look at the total cost of the new loan including the amount borrowed, the annual percentage rate (APR), the interest rate, the loan term (in months), and the monthly payment – before you agree to anything. If you don’t roll the amount you still owe on your old vehicle into the new loan, and keep your current vehicle while buying a new one, then you will have two loans and two monthly payments to make. Either way, you may want to consider whether it makes sense to go through with the transaction and purchase the next vehicle if you still owe money on your trade-in. If you owe more than your current vehicle is worth – sometimes referred to as “negative equity” – you should consider whether you can afford a new vehicle.To find out if you have negative equity, you should look up the approximate value of your current vehicle using websites such as the Consumer Reports, Edmunds, Kelley Blue Book, NADA Guides, and online classifieds. You may also find these and other resources at your local library. Look up the “private sale” value, because that’s what you can get if you sell your vehicle to an individual. Look up “Trade In to Dealer” if you want to see a range of prices for similar vehicles. Then call your lender to find out how much you still owe on your loan.A dealer may offer to “roll in” the balance of your old loan into a loan for a new vehicle. This is called a “negative trade-in,” because the trade-in adds to the cost of the new loan, rather than reducing it. This might make the new loan unaffordable. Be very careful to make sure you understand the total cost of the new loan and the monthly payments – and the loan term (in months) – before you agree to anything.

Before you shop, check your credit report at one of the three nationwide consumer reporting agencies – TransUnion, Equifax, and Experian – and check for errors. Incorrect, negative information in your file could prevent you from qualifying for some offers. If there are errors, you can ask that the credit errors be corrected. You should also know that 0% financing deals often require you to pay back the loan in a relatively short period of time, such as 36 months. In general, a shorter loan duration can be good for you because it means you will pay less interest over the course of the loan, but it means a higher monthly payment.Sometimes you get a choice between the promotional financing (which provides a lower interest rate) and a manufacturer’s rebate (which results in cash). You should shop around for other loans from banks or credit unions to find out whether you will save more money by taking the manufacturer’s rebate and arranging your own financing.",/askcfpb/781/i-saw-advertisement-0-financing-how-can-i-find-out-if-i-will-qualify.html,APPROVED,Auto loans,"Applying, shopping and negotiating",,<Question: 309 What is a credit report?> | <Question: 733 What is an auto loan interest rate?

If you don’t have the required insurance, the lender may take out “force-placed” insurance to cover your vehicle. Force-placed insurance protects only the lender, not you, and will add to the cost of your loan.

Those lender(s) may propose a rate to the dealer to finance the loan, referred to as the “buy rate” or may decline to finance the loan. The interest rate that you negotiate with the dealer may be higher than the “buy rate” because it may include an amount that compensates the dealer for handling the financing.  Dealers may have discretion to charge you more than the buy rate they receive from a lender, so you may be able to negotiate the interest rate the dealer quotes to you. Ask or negotiate for a loan with better terms. Be sure to compare the financing offered through the dealership with the rate and terms of any preapproval you received from a bank, credit union, or other lender. Choose the loan that best fits your budget.

This is what a co-signer does. A co-signer is a person who is obligated to pay back the loan just as you, the borrower, are obligated to pay.  A co-signer could be your spouse, a parent, or a friend. The lender cannot require your spouse to be a co-signer unless you are both applying for the loan. Having a co-signer on your loan can be a benefit to both you and your lender. Co-signing gives your lender additional assurance that the loan will be repaid. You may get a better interest rate with a co-signer.There are risks for the co-signer. The co-signer is also obligated on the loan. If you do not repay your loan, your co-signer will be liable for repayment even if the co-signer never drove your vehicle.

813,"If I co-sign on someone else’s auto loan, what does this mean?",,"If you co-sign a loan, you are legally obligated to repay the loan in full. Co-signing a loan does not mean serving as a character reference for someone else. When you co-sign, you promise to pay the loan yourself. It means that you risk having to repay any missed payments immediately. If the borrower defaults on the loan, the creditor can use the same collection methods against you that can be used against the borrower such as demanding that you repay the entire loan yourself, suing you, and garnishing your wages or bank accounts after a judgment. Your credit score(s) may be impacted by any late payments or defaults.Co-signing an auto loan does not mean you have any right to the vehicle, it just means that you have agreed to become obligated to repay the amount of the loan. So make sure you can afford to pay this debt if the borrower cannot.As co-signer, you should receive a separate notice by the lender prior to signing the agreement. The notice will contain the following information:You are being asked to guarantee this debt. Think carefully before you do. If the borrower doesn’t pay the debt, you will have to. Be sure you can afford to pay if you have to, and that you want to accept this responsibility.You may have to pay up to the full amount of the debt if the borrower does not pay. You may also have to pay late fees or collection costs, which increase this amount.The creditor can collect this debt from you without first trying to collect from the borrower. The creditor can use the same collection methods against you that can be used against the borrower, such as suing you, garnishing your wages, etc. If this debt is ever in default, that fact may become a part of your credit record.Co-signing a loan may also affect your ability to obtain loans for yourself because you have taken on the obligation to pay the loan. Lenders ask for a co-signer when they do not want to take on the full risk of loaning money to that particular borrower. Read the terms of the loan and consider carefully whether you wish to take the risk of co-signing.",/askcfpb/813/i-was-asked-co-sign-financing-car-what-am-i-being-asked-do-and-what-does-this-mean-for-me.html,APPROVED,Auto loans,"Understanding auto loans | Applying, shopping and negotiating",,"<Question: 745 What is a co-signer?> | <Question: 811 I was told I need to have a co-signer in order to get financing.

815,Should I buy or lease? What's the difference?,A lease is an agreement to use a vehicle for an agreed number of months and miles. You may lease a new or used vehicle.,"You do not own a leased vehicle and you are required to return the vehicle after the lease ends unless you exercise a purchase option.   Below are some of the factors in buying and leasing to help you compare your choices. Leasing a vehicle: Monthly payments may be lower than buying but the payments are going towards the depreciation of the vehicle during the lease term plus rent charges (similar to interest on a loan) and other fees. You may be responsible for early termination charges if you end the lease early. These fees can be very expensive. You will not be able to simply return the vehicle and stop making payments.At the end of your lease term you can either turn the vehicle in and pay any end-of-lease fees, or purchase the vehicle if your lease includes a purchase option.For most leases, the company or person leasing the vehicle to you assumes the risk of depreciation. Most leases include mileage restrictions of 10,000-15,000 miles per year. At the end of the lease, most leases also include fees for excessive mileage and wear and tear. The amount of excessive wear and tear is usually determined by the lessor. A typical lease is 2-4 years. Buying a vehicle: Monthly payments may be higher than leasing but part of each payment is going towards the purchase price of the vehicle. You might sell or trade-in the vehicle when you want to purchase a new one. You assume the risk of depreciation to your vehicle in regards to what it will be worth when you decide to sell or trade it in. You can drive as many miles as you want.  High mileage and excessive wear and tear will affect the vehicle’s resale value. A typical auto loan term is 4 to 6 years. You own the vehicle and get to keep it at the end of the financing term.If you decide to lease, you can and should negotiate the lease terms. You can compare different lease offers with the goal of negotiating terms such as the: Cost of the vehicle; Amount of any down payment or trade-in; Rent charge;Mileage limit, and Purchase option.Just as an auto loan is complicated, so is an auto lease. With a standard lease the majority of the monthly payment is the amount the vehicle will depreciate over the lease term plus a rent charge. Review this sample leasing form. The steps involved in calculating the monthly lease payment are generally as follows:  You and the leasing company decide on the cost of the vehicle minus any trade-in, down payment, or rebate. For example, $20,000.You decide on the lease term, typically 2-4 years. For example, 3 years/36 months.The leasing company will determine what the vehicle will be worth at the end of the lease, known as the “residual value.” For example, $8,000 is the residual value.The amount of depreciation is calculated by subtracting the residual value. For example, $20,000-$8,000=$12,000 of depreciation.The monthly payment will be calculated by adding the estimated amount of depreciation during your term plus the rent charge, taxes and fees, and dividing that amount by the number of months in the lease term. For example, $12,000 divided by 36 months equals $333. Note: If your lease includes a purchase option, you will want to consider how accurate the residual value estimate is because that residual value amount is often the purchase option price. TIP: Some dealerships, known as “lease here pay here” dealerships, lease older used vehicles. These dealerships lease to consumers with poor or no credit that often need quick access to a vehicle. Common features of a lease may be weekly or bi-weekly payments, high rent charges, and no repair or maintenance coverage. If the vehicle breaks down, you may be responsible for repairs. Before leasing any vehicle, determine if you will be able to afford the payments into the future and if this is the right deal for you. You should also ask if the vehicle will be equipped with a starter interrupt device that will shut down the ignition if you miss a lease payment.  You should carefully review the vehicle lease document and terms.

817,What is a retail installment sales contract or agreement? Is this a loan?,,"A retail installment sales contract agreement is slightly different from a loan. Both are ways for you to obtain a vehicle by agreeing to make payments over time. In both, you are generally bound to the agreement after signing.A loan is a transaction between you and a bank or other lender for money, where you use the money to purchase a vehicle and agree to repay the loan balance plus interest. A retail installment sale,on the other hand, is a transaction between you and the dealer to purchase a vehicle where you agree to pay the dealer over time, paying both the value of the vehicle plus interest. A dealer could sell the retail installment sales contract to a lender or other party. TIP:With a retail installment sales contract, you may have additional rights under your state’s law (for example, the ability to stop making payments to the dealer) if there is a defect in your vehicle.",/askcfpb/817/what-retail-installment-sales-contract-or-agreement-loan.html,APPROVED,Auto loans,Understanding auto loans,,"<Question: 733 What is an auto loan interest rate?

819,What is included in the monthly payment on an auto loan?,,"The monthly payment includes all charges agreed to in the contract. This will include the principal and the interest on your loan. Your monthly payment may also include credit insurance charges or other optional add-ons that you agreed to finance as part of your auto loan.

821,Is the price for add-ons such as an extended warranty or Guaranteed Auto Protection (GAP) insurance protectable?,,"Yes, the price for add-ons is negotiable, just like interest rates and the length of the loan. When you go to an auto dealer, you may be offered add-on products and services for the auto or for the loan. It’s a good idea to think about these add-ons ahead of time, so that you have less to worry about at the dealership, and have your answers ready when you are asked to buy these extras. Common add-ons include: Service contracts or extended warranties; GAP insurance; credit insurance;additional features for the vehicle, such as alarm systems, window tinting, etc.Add-on products and services are optional. If you buy them the price is negotiable. If you finance them, you will increase your loan amount. If you think you want these one or more of these products or services, shop around. For example, your own auto insurance company may offer GAP, credit insurance, or other alternatives. Other lenders may also offer these loan add-ons, often for much less.

825,What is the difference between a warranty and an extended warranty?,,"Warranties are typically provided by auto manufacturers as part of the overall cost of a new vehicle. These warranties will cover certain problems and last for a certain period of time or miles of driving.Extended warranties or service contracts are offered or sold at an additional charge by auto dealerships. These provide protection on certain mechanical and electrical components not covered by the manufacturer’s warranty. Extended warranties typically exclude routine maintenance such as oil changes and tire replacement. They can be very expensive for you. However, you don’t have to buy an extended warranty when you purchase a vehicle or at any time- they are completely optional.When deciding whether to purchase an extended warranty, you should review the contract carefully and consider the following: The cost of the extended warranty-you can negotiate the price What types of problems or repairs are  covered What problems are NOT covered How long the extended warranty lasts Whether or not the extended warranty coverage overlaps with the manufacturer’s warranty How you plan to use your vehicle  You should also check whether the coverage of the service contract overlaps with the problems and time periods the manufacturer’s warranty covers to avoid paying for unneeded coverage.

831,I bought a car and got a call from the salesperson who said that I need to come back to the dealership to discuss my loan.  I thought I had been approved.  What can I do?,,"Some dealers will allow the customer to take possession of the new vehicle before the loan is approved by the lender. This practice is sometimes called “spot delivery.” In some cases after you drive away with the vehicle but before the sale is finalized, the dealership will later tell you that they couldn’t make the loan at the agreed-upon terms. They then may ask you to bring back the vehicle and renegotiate the loan for a higher interest rate, a longer term, a larger down payment, or a combination of those terms. If this happens and you don’t agree to a second deal, the dealer will have to unwind the sale and give you back your trade-in and down payment. This is sometimes called a “yo-yo sale” and you may be entitled to legal protections in some situations.Before you drive off with your new vehicle, make sure: you reviewed the contract and disclosures before agreeing to the loan and auto sale to make sure you understand the terms of your deal; you have a signed copy of all documents that both you and the dealer have signed and that all blanks are filled in; the financing and the loan rate is final before you take the vehicle off the dealer’s lot.If the contract did not contain a clear statement that the deal was not final or that the sale was conditional on the dealer being able to find someone to buy your loan within a short duration of time, and if you already signed all of the documents before you left with the vehicle, you may have a right to keep it and make the payments as agreed. If you are asked to return to the dealer to discuss your financing and it was not disclosed to you that the deal was not yet final, you may submit a complaint to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) or in the case of a Buy Here Pay Here dealer, with the CFPB online or by calling us toll-free at 1-855-411-CFPB (2372).

The letter should include contact information and information about how and when you make payments. Make sure you keep and pay attention to your paperwork, as it can tell you: Who your lender or servicer is Where to send your paymentsWhat counts as an “on time” payment (usually when the lender receives it, not when you mail it) and whether there is a grace period The amount of any late fees Whether there is a penalty if you pay off the loan early (prepayment penalty)Who to contact if you are having difficulty making payments",/askcfpb/837/how-do-i-know-who-my-auto-loan-lender-or-servicer.html,APPROVED,Auto loans,Understanding auto loans,,"<Question: 839 If I pay late, will I have to pay a fee, and when will that fee be assessed?> | <Question: 849 What should I do if I expect difficulty making my auto loan payments?>",Auto Loan Complaint

841,"My contract says ""precomputed interest"" on it. What's the difference between a simple interest rate and precomputed interest?",,"Simple interest and precomputed interest are different ways to calculate your interest due. The simple interest method uses the amount or actual balance outstanding on the day your payment is due. If you pay more than your monthly payment, this amount should get smaller as you pay down your loan. The precomputed interest method always uses the original payment schedule to figure interest, even if you make payments early.If you have a contract with precomputed interest and plan to pre-pay your loan early in full or make larger payments in advance of your regularly scheduled amount, you will not get the same reduction in the interest charges that you would if your contract had a simple interest rate. If you pay on time for each payment over your loan term, there is little difference between simple and precomputed interest. TIP:If you think there’s a possibility you may want to pre-pay your loan in full or pay more than what you owe to pay your loan off earlier, a loan with precomputed interest may not make the most financial sense for you. Precomputed interest is generally not used by banks and credit unions. Some lenders may offer precomputed interest and others may not.

843,Can I prepay my loan at any time without penalty?,,"Whether you can pay off your auto loan early without a penalty depends on your contract and on your state’s law. If the lender wants to charge you a penalty or fee to pay off the loan early, the contract has to contain a prepayment penalty clause. Review your Truth in Lending disclosures and the contract before you sign the agreement. These documents will tell you whether there is a penalty for paying early. You should also ask your lender, or the dealer if you are getting dealer-financing, if there is a prepayment penalty. If there is, you can negotiate to have the penalty removed from the contract or ask for a different loan.Why it matters: If your loan has a high interest rate, you may later be able to refinance at a lower interest rate and payment. When you refinance, you prepay the original loan in full. Ask your bank, credit union, or other lender about interest rates. TIP:When you receive your Truth in Lending Act disclosure, review it along with your contract before signing. Look for information about your loan amount, your interest rate, Annual Percentage Rate, payment amount and any prepayment penalties. If what is on paper doesn’t  match what the lender or dealer told you, ask for an explanation and new paperwork. Remember, many aspects of the loan are negotiable. Ask for a loan that does not have a prepayment penalty if that is important to you. If you don’t like the terms of a loan and the lender won’t negotiate, you can always shop around for a different lender with terms that better suit your needs.",/askcfpb/843/can-i-prepay-my-loan-any-time-without-penalty.html,APPROVED,Auto loans,Trouble with payment or repossession,,<Question: 751 I'm thinking of buying or leasing a car.

If you do reach an agreement, get it in writing so there isn’t a dispute later.Refinance. You may be able to get a lower interest rate or spread out the payments over more time. Generally, a longer term loan means you will pay more in interest. Shop around.Sell your vehicle. Figure out how much you owe on the auto loan and then check the approximate market value of your vehicle. If you owe less than the value of the vehicle, you can sell it and use the proceeds to pay off the loan. Check your auto loan contract to see if you have a prepayment penalty for paying off early. If you do not pay, a lender can repossess your vehicle.  In many states, as soon as you’ve missed a payment on the vehicle, your lender has the right to take back or repossess the vehicle without warning you or getting a court order. Some states have laws that require a notice before repossession, alerting you to what payments have been missed, while also providing a short time period in which you can make up payments to prevent repossession. Servicemembers have additional repossession protections under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act for auto loans and leases taken out before entering military service.Lender may not “breach the peace” in repossessing. Under state law, a lender may not repossess a vehicle unless it can do so without a breach of peace. The definition of breach of the peace varies depending on your state law. Typically, it includes things like threatening or using physical force, removing a vehicle from a closed garage without permission, or continuing with repossession after you have resisted or refused to allow the repossession. If the lender commits a breach of the peace, you may contact law enforcement. A breach of the peace may also give you a claim for damages or a defense which may lessen the amount you eventually owe after the sale of the vehicle.Repossession methods.  Besides physically removing the vehicle, some lenders may also use a starter interrupt device (SID) in place of repossession or to help facilitate repossession. A SID is a device that allows a lender or lessor to remotely deactivate a vehicle’s ignition system if a borrower/lessee misses payments or defaults. The shut-down can be temporary, until a payment is made, or it can be done to make repossession easier. The rules on SIDs vary from state to state so ask your lender before signing the contract if your vehicle is equipped with a SID. If it is, you should ask how this process will work – for example, will you get any warning before the vehicle is shut down? Is there a way for the vehicle to be restarted in case of an emergency?You may have other rights and obligations under your state law. You may be able to get more information about your state law from your state attorney general, your state consumer protection office, a private attorney or your local legal services office.",/askcfpb/857/how-will-i-know-if-my-car-going-be-repossessed.html,APPROVED,Auto loans,Trouble with payment or repossession,,<Question: 861 What happens if I left some of my things in my vehicle and it was repossessed?>,Auto Loan Complaint

It is important to document what items you left in the vehicle and their estimated value. If your vehicle has been repossessed and you left property in your vehicle, contact your lender immediately to arrange to get your belongings.

865,"My car has been repossessed, and I was told it will be sold. What can I do?",Your rights after repossession vary depending on your state law.,"In some states there are laws granting a right to reinstate after repossession. These laws usually provide for a time period after repossession in which you can get your vehicle back by making up any existing overdue payments and the cost of repossession.If you don’t reinstate the loan or you live in a state where there is not a right to reinstate,  your  lender can either keep the vehicle as compensation for your debt or sell it at a private or public sale. For a public sale the lender must notify you of the date, time, and place of the sale so you can have a chance to bid on the vehicle. For a private sale the lender must notify you of the time after which the vehicle may be sold. In either a public or private sale, you may be entitled to buy back the vehicle by paying the full loan amount plus the repossession costs before the sale.Deficiency balance.  If your vehicle is repossessed and sold, you may be responsible for paying the difference between the amount left on your loan (plus repossession fees) and the sale price. This is known as a “deficiency balance”. For example, if you owe $10,000 on the vehicle and your creditor sells it in a commercially reasonable manner and gets $7,500, then the deficiency is $2,500 plus any other fees you owe. If you don’t pay the deficiency, the lender may hire a debt collector to attempt to collect the debt. The lender may also file a lawsuit in court against you to collect the deficiency. If the lender obtains a judgment from the court, the lender can garnish your wages and take other steps to collect the judgment. If there is a surplus of funds after your lender has applied the sale proceeds to your balance then you are entitled to those funds. You should make sure you know what the vehicle sold for and consult an attorney if you think the price was unreasonable.                                                                                                                                    Repossession costs. You will likely be charged for the cost of repossession. However, the fees for repossession must be reasonable. Reasonableness is ultimately determined by a court and will depend on the type of vehicle taken, how it was taken, and where it was taken. You should ask your lender for an accounting of the repossession costs.You may have other rights and obligations under your state law.

871,I leased my car and it was repossessed. Will I still owe money?,"If you miss payments, the dealership or finance company you lease your vehicle from, known as the “lessor,” may be entitled to repossess the vehicle.","Your lease agreement will state what constitutes a default of the lease as well as if there is any “grace period” in making lease payments. Not making a contractually required monthly payment will normally be a breach of the lease and the lessor can then repossess the vehicle from you.  You should contact your lender if you are unable to make your monthly payment on its due date. Servicemembers may have additional protections under the Servicemember’s Civil Relief Act.  You should contact your local JAG to find out if these protections apply.You may have a right to “cure” or reinstate the lease. Your lease contract, as well as your state law, may provide for a right to cure or reinstate the lease after a missed payment. If you have this right, it allows you to make up your missed lease payments before the vehicle is repossessed. You would generally receive a notice after a missed payment and one to two weeks to make up the missed payment. While only a minority of states provide for a right to cure before repossession, even fewer states provide for a right to cure after repossession. Check with your state attorney general or consumer protection office for more information on your state law.Your lessor cannot “breach the peace.” Your vehicle can only be repossessed if it can be done without breaching the peace. The definition of “breach of the peace” varies depending on your state law. Typically, it includes things like threatening or using physical force, removing a vehicle from a closed garage without permission, or continuing with repossession after you have resisted or refused to allow the repossession. Repossession methods.  Besides physically removing the vehicle, a lessor may also use a starter interrupt device (SID) in place of repossession or to help facilitate repossession. A SID is a device that allows a lessor to remotely deactivate a vehicle’s ignition system if a borrower/lessee misses payments or defaults. The shut-down can be temporary, until a payment is made, or it can be done to make repossession easier. The rules on SIDs vary from state to state so ask your lessor before signing the contract if your vehicle is equipped with a SID. If it is, you should ask if there are any warnings given before the vehicle is shut down. You may also want to ask if there is a way for the vehicle to be re-activated in case of an emergency.You may be liable for early termination fees. Defaulting on a lease or voluntarily returning your vehicle to the lessor can trigger a substantial early termination fee. Check your lease agreement. Under the federal Consumer Leasing Act, the method for calculating the early termination fee must be disclosed in the lease. The early termination fee is generally the difference between the early termination payoff and the amount credited to you for the vehicle. Suppose, for example, that your early termination payoff amount is $16,000 and the amount credited for the vehicle is $14,000. The early termination charge would be $16,000 minus $14,000, or $2,000. The earlier your lease is terminated, the greater this charge is likely to be. If you are unable to pay the early termination fee, and default, the lessor can report the amount of delinquent fees to the credit bureau.If you are charged an early termination fee, be sure you understand how it is being calculated and consult an attorney if you think it has been done incorrectly.",/askcfpb/871/i-leased-my-car-and-it-was-repossessed-will-i-still-owe-money.html,APPROVED,Auto loans,Leasing,,<Question: 857 How will I know if my car is going to be repossessed?> | <Question: 861 What happens if I left some of my things in my vehicle and it was repossessed?>,Auto Loan Complaint
873,"I am in the military (Active, Guard or Reserves). What legal protections do I have if I get activated, ordered to move, or deployed?","The SCRA gives you and your family certain legal and financial protections relating to installment contracts, like an auto loan.","The SCRA prohibits creditors from repossessing personal property, including your vehicle, without a court order, based on breach of a pre-service contract. That means that even if you breach your contract by, for example, failing to make your monthly payments, the creditor must first file a lawsuit and get an order from a judge before your vehicle can be repossessed. This protection only applies if you:purchased or leased the vehicle, or other personal property, before entering military service (see Tip below for more information); and made a deposit or installment payment on the property before entering military service (see Tip below for more information).   Tip:For members of Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, or Coast Guard, “military service” is defined as serving on active duty under Title 10 section 101(d)(1) of the United States Code.  This is commonly referred to as being on “Title 10 status.”  For members of the National Guard, “military service” is defined as “service under a call to active service authorized by the President or the Secretary of Defense for a period of more than 30 consecutive days under section 502(f) of title 32, United States Code, for purposes of responding to a national emergency declared by the President and supported by Federal funds.”  The key here is that the call to service must be federally ordered, not by state. Even if you’re protected by the SCRA from repossession without a court order, failure to pay still may mean you’re breaching the contract and you still may be charged fees associated with your failure to pay, such as a late fee. Your missed payments can be reported to credit reporting agencies and you could have debt collection or a lawsuit to collect the money filed against you.  These Federal protections under the SCRA are in addition to any other protections you might have under your state law.

You may see signs like “no credit – no problem” or “military E-1 and up.” The interest rate on loans from these dealerships can be much higher than loans from a bank, credit union, or other lender.Normally, a bank, credit union, or other lender will limit the amount it will lend for the purchase of a vehicle based on the vehicle’s value. Those lenders will not loan more than the value because the vehicle in question simply isn’t worth it. But when a dealer acts as its own “bank,” it may not set such limits. So you may end up paying thousands of dollars more than the actual value. In other words, with “buy here, pay here,” there is a bigger risk that you will borrow to pay more than the vehicle is worth.Don’t be fooled into thinking that you have no choice. Even if you have poor or no credit, there may be other lenders that are willing to finance your vehicle purchase.

You can ask your lender for an SCRA interest-rate reduction at any time while you’re serving on active duty and up to 180 days after your release from active duty and it will be applied retroactively back to when you entered active duty.  This SCRA right also applies to loans that were obtained by you and your spouse together – but NOT to loans taken out solely by your spouse/dependent.  If your lender refuses to drop your interest rate to 6%, contact your local JAG office or financial readiness office for more information.

915,What is a money market account?,A money market account is a special type of account offered by banks and credit unions.,"Money market accounts are sometimes called money market deposit accounts or money market savings accounts.Like a regular savings account, a money market account at a bank is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), while one at a credit union is insured by the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA). You cannot withdraw money or make payments more than six times a month from a money market account by check, debit card, draft, or electronic transfer. Withdrawals or payments by ATM, in person, by mail, messenger, or telephone check (where payment is made by using your checking account number and bank routing number) do not count against the six-transaction limit. Your bank or credit union may also have a minimum deposit that it requires to open a money market account.A money market account is different from a money market mutual fund, or a money market fund. Money market funds are offered by investment companies and others. Money market funds are not insured by the FDIC or the NCUA, which means you could possibly lose money investing in a money market fund.",/askcfpb/915/what-money-market-account.html,APPROVED,Bank accounts and services,Other types of bank accounts and services,,<Question: 1005 Is there a limit on how much I can deposit into my savings account?> | <Question: 1007 Is a money market account insured?> | <Question: 1009 The bank/credit union stopped paying interest on my money market account because I wrote too many checks.

917,What is a certificate of deposit (CD)?,"A Certificate Deposit, or CD, is a special type of savings account offered by banks or credit unions. You generally must keep your funds in the CD for a specified period of time to avoid penalties.","A CD is also called a “time deposit.” The end of that time period is called the “maturity date.” The size of the penalty you will pay if you remove money from a CD before the maturity date will vary. You can find out what the penalty is before you purchase a CD. Some institutions may agree in advance to waive the penalty for withdrawing the money from the CD before its maturity date if you have held the CD for a minimum period of time. CDs offered by banks are insured (up to $250,000) by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), while those offered by credit unions are insured up to $250,000 by the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA). Tip:Select your CD maturity date based on your expected needs. For example, if you will need the money you are going to invest in a CD in five years, you should compare the terms of CDs offered on the assumption that you will withdraw the money at that time.",/askcfpb/917/what-certificate-deposit-cd.html,APPROVED,Bank accounts and services,Other types of bank accounts and services,,<Question: 921 The interest rate offered for CDs (certificates of deposit) is low.

921,The interest rate offered for CDs (certificates of deposit) is low. Is there anything I can do about that?,,"You have many different options when choosing a CD that can affect the interest rate. Generally, you may be able to get a higher interest rate by selecting a later maturity date, which means you must leave your money in the CD longer. For example, a two-year CD generally will have a higher interest rate than a six-month CD.Another possible option is a variable-rate CD, sometimes called a “multi-step,” “bonus rate,” or “step up” CD. The interest rates on these CDs may change according to rules explained by the CD issuer. Choosing a variable-rate CD can increase or decrease your overall earnings for that CD.“Callable CDs” may also offer higher rates. A callable CD is one in which the bank or credit union can end the CD agreement before the maturity date and return your money with the interest that has been earned to that point. Because you take some risk in not knowing whether your callable CD will reach full maturity, banks and credit unions typically offer higher rates on callable CDs than they do on other CDs. But, if the bank or credit union decides to “call” your CD early, you may be forced to withdraw your money or to reinvest in a product with a lower rate. The CD agreement will indicate whether or not your CD is callable. The CD with the highest rate may not always be the best fit for your needs. You should look closely at the different terms to see what type of CD might be right for you. Tip:If you are flexible about how long you can leave your money in the CD, ask if there are any promotional rates. Some banks and credit unions offer a promotional rate for a certain length of CD. If you pick the promotional CD, you may get a higher interest rate.",/askcfpb/921/interest-rate-offered-cds-certificates-deposit-low-there-anything-i-can-do-about.html,APPROVED,Bank accounts and services,Other types of bank accounts and services,,<Question: 917 What is a certificate of deposit (CD)?> | <Question: 923 What is a certificate of deposit (CD) rollover or renewal?>,Bank Account or Service Complaint
923,What is a certificate of deposit (CD) rollover or renewal?,,"A rollover or renewal can occur at the end of the term of a CD. If your CD has a rollover or renewal, the money you originally deposited will be invested in a new CD. The interest already earned may also be invested in the new CD. Some CDs don’t have a rollover feature so when they mature they will stop earning interest.Your bank or credit union may rollover your CD automatically at the end of the CD term unless you tell them not to. However, a bank or credit union is required to send you a notice in writing before the CD matures, and the notice will tell you when your current CD ends and whether it will renew automatically. Tip:Compare rates before you roll over or renew an existing CD. The interest rate for the new CD is not guaranteed to be the same as the interest rate for your current CD – it may be higher or lower. You may want to see if your bank or credit union is offering a promotional rate that is better than the rate on the rollover or renewal CD.",/askcfpb/923/what-certificate-deposit-cd-rollover-or-renewal.html,APPROVED,Bank accounts and services,Other types of bank accounts and services,,<Question: 917 What is a certificate of deposit (CD)?> | <Question: 921 The interest rate offered for CDs (certificates of deposit) is low.

These accounts may have higher fees than checking accounts that don’t pay interest. These accounts may also require a larger minimum balance to avoid monthly fees. It is always a good idea to compare checking account fees and terms to see which account and fee structure will cost you less for the way you actually bank.Tip: Because interest rates on deposit accounts are currently very low, fees and minimum balance requirements usually have a much bigger impact on the net value of a checking account than any interest you might earn on a checking account.",/askcfpb/925/should-i-get-checking-account-pays-interest.html,APPROVED,Bank accounts and services,Understanding checking accounts,,<Question: 919 Can I open checking or savings accounts with more than one bank at a time?> | <Question: 927 Can I get a checking account without a driver's license?> | <Question: 929 Can I get a checking account without a social security number?>,Bank Account or Service Complaint

977,How can I reduce the costs of my checking account?,,"You can reduce the cost of using your checking account by taking the following steps:Pay attention to what transactions or events are triggering fees. Find out whether you might be able to alter your banking behavior to avoid these fees. For example, you may save a few dollars by using your bank’s or credit union’s ATMs rather than those of another institution or by signing up for account alerts that help you stop from spending more than you have. Talk to your bank or credit union about possible solutions.Avoid spending more than you have. Bounced check penalties can be significant, and overdraft fees are an especially costly way to borrow money. Keep careful track of the balance in your account and confirm that deposited funds are available before making a payment or withdrawal that might exhaust your account. Check your balance at the ATM before you withdraw cash, and see if you can sign up to get low-balance warnings via e-mail or text. You can also monitor your balance online.Keep track of your account. Monitor your account online to keep track of what’s coming in and going out. If you have questions, ask your bank or credit union for an explanation. Review your account statement every month to make sure it’s correct. Report any errors immediately to your bank or credit union. Banks and credit unions must tell you when they change their terms of service, so any time you get a piece of mail from your bank or credit union, read it.Reduce monthly service charges. Know the minimum balance requirement. Ask if direct deposit or electronic banking can lower the monthly fee. See if the bank or credit union offers a low-fee checking account for you, such as a seniors or students account, or just a basic checking account with a low minimum balance and a limited number of “free” checks and withdrawals. You may also be able to avoid monthly maintenance fees by consolidating accounts and maintaining a higher balance.Shop around. Get a copy of your bank or credit union’s list of account fees, or ask about them, then compare them with account fees at other banks or credit unions. Assess your habits honestly and consider penalty fees, such as overdraft and non-sufficient funds charges, as well as monthly maintenance, ATM surcharge, and other service fees. When comparing banks or credit unions, also consider factors such as the hours of operation, locations, access to public transportation, available products and services, and reputation for customer service.",/askcfpb/977/how-can-i-reduce-costs-my-checking-account.html,APPROVED,Bank accounts and services,Overdraft fees and other fees,,"<Question: 961 I opened a ""free"" checking account but there are fees charged on my account.

979,How do I avoid or minimize overdraft fees?,,"If you pay overdraft fees regularly, you are paying a lot for very short-term cash advances. Here are some steps to reduce those costs:Track your balance. To avoid overdraft fees and not-sufficient funds (NSF) fees, you should always track your balance as carefully as you can. It may be possible to sign up for low balance alerts through your bank, credit union, or other service providers. These alerts can help you know when you are at risk of overdrawing your account. If you have regular electronic transfers, such as rent, mortgage payments, or utility bills, make sure you know how much they will be and on what day they occur. You also need to know when the funds you have deposited become available for your use, so you can ensure you have enough money in your account.Opt out of overdraft coverage. If you are paying a lot of overdraft fees, consider opting out of overdraft coverage for debit purchases or ATM withdrawals. Without overdraft coverage, your card will be declined if you don’t have enough money in your account to cover a debit purchase or ATM withdrawal. You won’t be able to complete the transaction, but you won’t incur an overdraft fee either. If you have chosen a debit card overdraft program, you can change your mind any time. Just let your financial institution know and it must honor your change request as soon as reasonably practicable.Link to a savings account. To reduce the costs of overdrafting, link your checking account to a savings account. If you overdraw your checking account, money will be taken from your linked savings account to cover the difference as long as you have sufficient funds in your savings account. You may be charged a transfer fee each time this happens, but it is usually much lower than the fee for an overdraft.Get a line of credit. As an alternative to a linked savings account, ask your bank or credit union if you are eligible for a line of credit or link to a credit card to cover overdrafts. You may have to pay a fee when the credit line is tapped, and you will owe interest on the amount you borrowed, but this is usually a much cheaper way to cover a brief cash shortfall.The CFPB is currently looking closely at overdraft practices and collecting information about them.

Be sure to include any bills you have authorized to be paid directly from your checking account, such as utility bills or credit card bills.If you have direct deposit, fill out the papers directing your employer to reroute your paychecks to your new account. Do the same for any other direct deposit, such as Social Security payments.Find out the date your direct deposits will transfer. Once you know the date of the first direct deposit, arrange for your automatic debits and withdrawals to be made from your new account and be sure to cancel them from your old account. Leave enough money in your old checking account to cover any checks that haven’t cleared or automatic payments that haven’t been made to avoid any fees.Once you’re certain all direct deposits and automatic payments are coming in to and going out of your new account, transfer the remaining funds from your old checking account into your new account. You can do this fastest electronically or by using a cashier’s check. Using a personal check may be cheaper than using a cashier’s check, but there may be a longer wait before it is available in your new account.Once the transfer clears your new account, close the old account.

1017,I discovered a debit card/online/ATM/automatic deduction transaction that I did not authorize. How do I recover my money?,Contact your bank or credit union immediately if you suspect an unauthorized transaction from your bank account,"If the transaction was made using a debit card or other electronic fund transfers, you may have additional protections under federal law. Electronic fund transfers include ATM transactions, purchases using your debit card, some online bill payments, and payments you’ve set up to be deducted from your account automatically. If you lost your card or PINLet’s say you lost your debit card or PIN or either was stolen. If you notify your bank or credit union within two business days of discovering the loss or theft of the card, the bank or credit union can’t hold you responsible for more than the amount of any unauthorized transactions or $50, whichever is less. If you notify your bank or credit union after two business days, you could be responsible for up to $500 in unauthorized transactions.Also, if your bank or credit union sends your statement that shows an unauthorized debit, you should notify them within 60 days. If you wait longer, you could also have to pay the full amount of any transactions that occurred after the 60-day period and before you notify your bank or credit union. In order to hold you responsible for those transactions, your bank or credit union would have to show that if you notified them before the end of the 60-day period, the transactions would not have occurred. Tips: Report your lost or stolen card or PIN within two business days of when you discover it is missing so you limit your losses to $50 or less, no matter how much is charged to your card.If someone steals the security code or PIN to your debit card or bank account, you should follow the same steps as you would if someone stole your card. You should notify your bank or credit union within two business days of discovering the loss or theft of your security code or PIN. Never write your PIN on your debit card or keep it written down in your wallet, in case your card or wallet is lost or stolen. Although the protections for unauthorized transactions still apply, you will still have to go through the process of recovering your funds. If you didn’t lose your card or PINIf an unauthorized transaction appears on your statement, but you did not lose your card, security code, or PIN or had any of them stolen, you should still notify your bank or credit union right away. At the latest, you must notify your bank within 60 days after your bank or credit union sends your statement showing the unauthorized transaction. If you wait longer, you could have to pay the full amount of any transactions that occurred after the 60-day period and before you notify your bank. In order to hold you responsible for those transactions, your bank would have to show that if you notified them before the end of the 60-day period, the transactions would not have occurred.In extenuating circumstances, like lengthy travel or hospitalization that keeps you from notifying the bank within the time allowed, the notification periods above must be extended. What does the bank have to do once I report it? Can I get my money back?Once you notify your bank or credit union, it generally has ten business days to investigate the issue (20 business days if the account has been open less than 30 days). The bank or credit union must correct an error within one business day after determining that an error has occurred. Your bank or credit union then has three business days to report its findings to you. If the bank or credit union can’t complete its investigation within ten (or 20) business days as applicable, it must generally issue a temporary credit to your account for the amount of the disputed transaction, minus a maximum of $50, while it continues to investigate.In certain circumstances, however, it does not have to issue a temporary credit. For example, the bank or credit union may require you to provide written confirmation of the error if you initially provided the information by telephone. If you are asked to follow up in writing and you do not do so within ten business days, the bank or credit union is not required to temporarily credit your account during the course of its investigation. The bank or credit union must then resolve the issue in 45 days, unless the disputed transactions were conducted in a foreign country, were conducted within 30 days of account opening, or were debit card point-of-sale purchases. In those cases, you may have to wait as long as 90 days for the issue to be fully resolved.If the bank or credit union determines that the transactions were in fact authorized, it must provide you with written notice before taking the money that was credited to you during the investigation out of your account.",/askcfpb/1017/how-do-I-get-my-money-back-after-I-discovered-an-unauthorized-transaction-or-money-missing-from-my-bank-account.html,APPROVED,Bank accounts and services,Direct deposit and electronic fund transfers | Fraud or scam | Other problems with a bank account or service,,<Question: 1015 A deposit was credited to my account by mistake.

1023,How quickly can I get money after I deposit a check?,"Each bank or credit union has its own rules as to when it will let you access money after you deposit a check, but federal law establishes the maximum length of time a bank or credit union can make you wait.","Generally, if you deposit a check or checks for $200 or less in person to a bank employee, you can access the full amount the next business day. If you deposit checks totaling more than $200, you can access $200 the next business day, and the rest of the money the second business day.If your deposit is a certified check, a check from another account at your bank or credit union, or a check from the government, you can withdraw or use the full amount on the next business day if you make the deposit in person to a bank employee.If you make a check deposit at an ATM at your bank, you can withdraw or use the full amount on the second business day.Your bank or credit union has a cut-off time for what it considers the end of the business day. If you make a deposit after the cut-off time, the bank or credit union can treat your deposit as if it was made on the next business day. A bank or credit union’s cut-off time for receiving deposits can be no earlier than 2:00 p.m. at physical locations and no earlier than noon at an ATM or elsewhere.The amount of time a bank or credit union holds funds you deposit by check is sometimes referred to as a “deposit hold” or “check hold”. Some banks or credit unions may make funds available more quickly than the law requires, and some may expedite funds availability for a fee. If you need the money from a particular check, you can ask the teller when the funds will become available. A receipt showing your deposit does not mean that the money is available for you to use. It may take longer for you to access your deposit for a few reasons: If you have a new account or if your account has been overdrawn too many times in the past six months; If you make a deposit over $5,000; If you make a deposit at an ATM owned by someone other than your bank or credit union; or If the bank or credit union reasonably believes the deposited check may be uncollectible. If you or your bank redeposit a check that has been returned unpaid.

You can overdraw your account through checks, ATM transactions, debit card purchases, automatic bill payments, and electronic or in-person withdrawals.Many banks and credit unions offer overdraft protection programs in which the bank or credit union generally pays the transaction and charges you a fee (in addition to requiring repayment of the overdraft amount). Overdrafts can also be covered through a transfer of funds from a linked account, credit card, or line of credit. Tip:Know your fees. Banks and credit unions have different fees associated with overdraft protection so be sure to ask what the account terms are with respect to the cost of overdraft protection, a linked account or a line of credit, when shopping for a checking account. Tip:Deposits to your account may not be immediately available for your use. Always make sure you have sufficient available funds in your account.

However, banks and credit unions are allowed to charge you overdraft fees when the bank or credit union pays a check or certain recurring electronic payments that would have overdrawn your account, even if you did not opt in.","Some banks may also allow you to opt-out of overdrafts for checks and other types of payments. However, consumers that decline overdraft coverage for checks or ACH transactions may be charged a non-sufficient funds (NSF) fee from the bank or credit union, which is generally the same amount as an overdraft fee. In addition, declined payments to merchants may trigger a returned item fee from the merchant. If you had an account open as of July 2010, your bank or credit union may have sent you paperwork asking you to opt in to allow overdrafts on debit card transactions and ATM withdrawals. If you opened a new account since then, you may have signed a document authorizing overdraft protection when you opened the account.If you are enrolled in a fee-based debit overdraft program, you can change your mind at any time. Just notify the bank or credit union that you don’t want debit overdraft coverage. If you do not believe you’ve authorized debit overdraft protection, and the bank or credit union charges you a debit overdraft fee, you may file a complaint.If you have chosen not to enroll in a debit overdraft program, the bank or credit union will decline ATM or debit card transactions when your account doesn’t have enough funds to cover them, and you will not be charged a fee when this happens.

1053,How can I avoid debit card overdrafts?,,"You can avoid debit card overdraft fees by declining to opt in to debit card overdraft or by cancelling debit card overdraft coverage if you have opted into it.There are alternatives to debit card overdraft. If you have a savings account at the same bank or credit union as your checking account, most banks and credit unions will allow you to link the two accounts. This way, if you overdraw your checking account, the bank or credit union will transfer money from your savings account to cover the overdraft. There usually is a fee charged when this occurs, but it is generally less than an overdraft fee.Many banks and credit unions also offer an overdraft line of credit to consumers who qualify for such credit. If you qualify and overdraw your checking account, the overdraft will be covered by the line of credit. In essence, this gives you the ability to borrow money to cover an overdraft. There usually is a fee charged when this occurs. In addition, you will be charged interest on the amount you borrow to cover the overdraft. That fee and the interest charged are usually lower than the fee charged per overdrawn item in connection with a bank or credit union’s standard overdraft practices.To reduce all overdraft-related fees, you should always track your balance as carefully as you can. It may be possible to sign up for low balance alerts through your bank or other service providers. These alerts can help you know when you are at risk of overdrawing your account.If you have regular electronic transfers, such as mortgage payments or utility bills, make sure you know how much they will be and on what day they occur so you can ensure you have enough money in your account.",/askcfpb/1053/how-can-i-avoid-debit-card-overdrafts.html,APPROVED,Bank accounts and services,Overdraft fees and other fees | Issues with debit cards,,"<Question: 1047 My bank/credit union offered to link my checking account to a savings account, a line of credit, or a credit card to cover overdrafts.

1113,I tried to open a checking account but was told that I had a negative report with a credit bureau that had checking account information about me. Who are they and what can I do about it?,,"If you’ve tried opening a checking account and the bank or credit union denied your application, it may be because a checking account reporting company has negative information in its files about your checking history.You may have negative information in your file if you had a checking account before and you: • Have an unpaid negative balance on that account, such as from an overdraft, that you have not repaid and the account was closed by the bank or credit union (this is called an “involuntary closure”).  • Were suspected of fraud related to a checking account. • Had a joint account with someone else who had these types of problems.Banks and credit unions supply this type of negative information to checking account reporting companies, such as Chex Systems and Early Warning Services.  These companies compile and use the information to create reports of an individual’s prior checking account history.  Banks and credit unions may use these reports to help determine whether to offer you a checking account and the type of checking account to offer you. (Retailers may use a similar report to decide if they will accept your checks.)Tip: If you’ve had difficulty opening or managing a checking account, click here for consumer guides on choosing and managing checking accounts. See our consumer guide to selecting a lower risk accountSee our consumer guide to managing your checking accountSee our consumer guide to checking account denialsYou might also consider getting a prepaid card. What are my rights?Accuracy: Checking account reporting companies must comply with the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). This means they must follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of the information in the reports, and they can’t include most negative information that’s more than seven years old.  In practice, some checking account reporting companies disregard information that is more than five years old.Know what’s in your report: Nationwide checking account reporting companies must provide consumers with one free annual report per year, upon request.  You have to request the reports individually from each reporting company. We’ve put together a list of some of these checking account reporting companies, along with some information about how you can obtain copies of your reports.You also have the right to request a free report if you have received an “adverse action” notice. For example, let’s say a bank turns you down for a checking account based on a checking account report. This is an example of an “adverse action”. The bank must provide you with an “adverse action” notice that includes the name and contact information of the checking account reporting agency from which the bank got the report. You can contact the reporting company and request a free copy of the report. Investigate and correct errors: All checking account reporting companies must investigate consumers’ disputes of inaccurate information on their reports and correct any inaccurate information. Banks and credit unions that report information to checking account reporting companies also have an obligation to investigate and correct disputed information. Here are some steps you can take if you’ve been denied an account:   • Get a copy of your checking account report and review it for any errors. Ask the bank or credit union to provide you with the name of the checking account reporting company that provided the negative information. Contact the company to obtain a free copy of your report and review it for any errors. If you spot any errors, file a dispute.• Check your other credit reports. Some banks and credit unions will use your traditional credit reports, in addition to, or instead of a checking account report, to decide whether to give you a checking account. Get more information about requesting copies of your credit reports.• Find out if the bank or credit union has steps you can take to open an account, or offers lower-risk accounts. If not, consider trying another financial institution. Each bank or credit union has its own policies about the way the information in your checking account report impacts your ability to open an account.  Some banks and credit unions require you to pay any old, unpaid charges and fees before you are allowed to open a new account. Many banks and credit unions offer checking accounts and prepaid cards that are designed to reduce risks for both you and financial institution, by preventing overdraft and overdraft fees.  Because these products are considered less risky, many banks and credit unions may be less reliant on checking account reports when making a decision about a potential customer. As a result, you may be able to qualify for one of these products even if you were denied for another product recently.

1145,I would like to be able to have my friend or family member help with my bill-paying and banking. What are my options?,You have several options when deciding to have someone help with your bill paying and banking. These options include opening specific types of checking accounts or creating specific legal documents that give another person the power to handle your money.,"Informal help with money management If you are still able to handle your banking and bill-paying but would like some help going through the bills and budgeting, a friend or family member can review your bills with you and help you figure out which ones to pay and when. Under this arrangement, you still sign your checks and no one else is authorized to make account transactions.If you have no friends or family members to help you with informal money management, there are organized programs that provide trained staff members or volunteers to help. To locate a money management program in your area, try contacting your local Area Agency on Aging. You may also be able to find a money management program along with other resources for Older Americans by contacting the Eldercare Locator or by calling 1-800-677-1116.If you get help from a money management program, check on whether the program has insurance or bonding so your money is protected in a worst case scenario involving mismanagement or theft by the person assisting you.Joint accountIf you would like to enable a friend or family member to write checks and make deposits on your behalf, you may open a joint account. Generally, everyone whose name is on a joint account can write checks, withdraw money, and make transactions. Similarly, if one of the account holders owes money, the creditor can try to collect from money in the joint bank account.If the money in your joint bank account belongs to you, is not meant to be a gift to the joint account holder, and is meant to be folded in with your other assets for distribution according to your will or estate plan, you may be taking some risks by opening a joint bank account because: Your friend or family member can withdraw money for his or her own use or mismanage your money Creditors of your friend or family member may use legal processes to try to satisfy their debts from your money in the accountWhen you die, depending on the terms of the account and state law, money in the joint account may be distributed by the bank to the friend or family member whose name is on your account, without regard to the provisions of your will or other estate planning provisionsConvenience accountA “convenience account” or “agency account” enables you to designate a family member or friend to help you by depositing or withdrawing money and writing checks. A convenience account does not change the ownership of the money in the account or give your helper the right to keep the money when you die. Note, however, that any friend or family member you designate to help you can both deposit and withdraw money from your account, which exposes you to the risk that they might withdraw your money for their own use. Tip: Ask your bank about opening a convenience account or agency account. Often bank employees don’t mention these options or may not know they exist. You may need to speak with a manager.Explain that you want an account in which the money remains yours but someone else’s name will be on the account to help you with bill paying and other transactions. Be sure to say that you don’t want the other person to have the “right of survivorship” if you don’t intend for your money to become your helper’s money upon your death.Power of attorney (POA) for financesYou can name a friend or family member to act on your behalf by creating and signing a document called a power of attorney (or “durable” power of attorney). In that case, your bank account can remain in your name only, but the person you name in your power of attorney – your “agent” – can help you with banking. If you or your agent shares a copy of the power of attorney document with bank employees, they should honor the document and allow your agent to stand in your shoes to handle your bank transactions.Again, give considerable thought before you grant anyone power of attorney, as he or she might withdraw money from your account for reasons that you do not specify.",/askcfpb/1145/i-would-be-able-have-my-friend-or-family-member-help-my-bill-paying-and-banking-what-are-my-options.html,APPROVED,Bank accounts and services,Understanding checking accounts | Money management,Older Americans,"<Question: 1147 A financial planner offered to help with my bill paying and banking, but said the only way she or he could help is if I opened a joint account with both of our names on it.

1147,"A financial planner offered to help with my bill paying and banking, but said the only way she or he could help is if I opened a joint account with both of our names on it. Is this true?",,"No. Hiring someone to help with financial services – whether it is money management, financial planning, or other services – generally does not involve or require adding the person’s name to your bank account.Joint bank accounts usually enable all account holders to withdraw money and to retain the money in the account if the other owner dies. For this reason, you should be very careful about whose name you add to your bank account and be certain of what you are allowing that person to do.If anyone – a financial services professional, money manager, or anyone else – tells you that he or she can only provide services if you add him or her to your bank account or otherwise give access to your money, you should think seriously about whether the person is a legitimate business or professional and whether you want their involvement.There are ways that you can enable someone to help you with bill paying and banking, but you should only make arrangements with safeguards to ensure that a third party doesn’t misuse your money. Convenience bank accounts, powers of attorney (carefully written and granted to trusted individuals), trust arrangements, and others can accomplish your goals without unknowingly giving away your savings.

1149,What is a power of attorney (POA)?,A power of attorney is a legal document that allows someone else to act on your behalf.,"Powers of attorney can be helpful to older people and others who want to choose a trusted person to act when they cannot. Creating a POA is a private way to appoint a substitute decision-maker and is relatively inexpensive, although it may involve help from a lawyer. If you don’t create a POA in advance, a friend or family member might have to go to court to have a guardian appointed – and that process can be lengthy, expensive, and very public.A financial POA can be used as a tool for planning for future incapacity – an inability to make financial decisions due, for example, to dementia, traumatic brain injury, or some other impairment that affects mental function. When used for advance planning, a POA generally is “durable,” meaning it continues to be effective even if the person creating it becomes incapacitated.A financial POA can also be used for short-term purposes: for example, if a servicemember is deployed overseas, he or she may create a POA so someone can pay bills, sell property, or handle other business in his or her absence.However, a POA does involve some risk. It gives someone else – your agent – a great deal of authority over your finances without regular oversight. POA abuse can take many forms: The POA document itself may be a forgery Your agent might pressure you for authority that you do not want to grant Your agent may spend your money on himself rather than for your benefitYour agent might do things you didn’t authorize him to do – for example, make gifts or change beneficiaries on insurance policies or retirement plansMany states have laws in place to allow your agent to act appropriately on your behalf and to prevent POA abuse. To find out more about legal services in your state, contact your area agency on aging. TIP: Protect against POA abuse by doing the following:Trust, but verify. Only appoint someone you really trust and make sure they know your wishes and preferences. You can require in your POA that your agent regularly report to another person on the financial transactions he or she makes on your behalf.Tell other friends, family members, and financial advisers about your POA so they can look out for you.Remember that POA designations are not written in stone – you can change them. If you decide that your agent isn’t the best person to handle your finances, you can revoke (cancel) your POA.Beware of someone who wants to help you out by handling your finances and be your new “best friend.” If an offer of help seems too good to be true, it probably is.",/askcfpb/1149/what-power-attorney-poa.html,APPROVED,Bank accounts and services,Money management,Older Americans | Servicemembers,"<Question: 1147 A financial planner offered to help with my bill paying and banking, but said the only way she or he could help is if I opened a joint account with both of our names on it.

1157,Can a debt collector take my Social Security or VA benefits?,"Generally no, debt collectors can’t take your Social Security or VA benefits directly out of your bank account or prepaid card.","After a debt collector sues you for the debt and wins a judgment, it can get a court order for your bank or credit union to turn over money from your account or prepaid card. This is called a “garnishment.” A U.S. Department of Treasury rule requires banks to automatically protect  certain federal benefits from being frozen or garnished if they are direct deposited into your account. There are some exceptions to this rule, which are explained below. Read about how the automatic protection works. Benefits covered by this rule: Social Security Supplemental Security Income VeteransFederal Railroad retirement, unemployment and sickness Civil Service Retirement System Federal Employee Retirement System. Your bank or credit union must automatically protects 2 months’ worth of benefitsIf a collector tries to garnish money in your account, your bank must look at your account history to see if you received any of the above benefits by direct deposit in the last 2 months. The bank must protect 2 months’ worth of benefits from garnishment and let you use that money. If your account has more than 2 months’ worth of benefits, your bank can garnish or freeze the extra money. However, if that extra money that is garnished is exempt from garnishment under federal or state law, you may be able to go to court to have your money released. Benefits on a prepaid cardMany people receive federal benefits such as Social Security or VA on a prepaid card. If your benefits are loaded onto a Direct Express card or to another prepaid account, they are still automatically protected from garnishment just like money in a bank account.To take advantage of the automatic protections for direct deposited Social Security and VA benefits, you can sign up to have these benefits direct deposited to your bank account or loaded onto a prepaid card. Examples of how the automatic protection works If you receive $1,000 in Social Security each month, your bank will see that $2,000 in Social Security was direct deposited in the last 2 months. The bank must allow you to use up to $2,000 in the account. If you receive $1,000 in Social Security benefits by direct deposit each month, and you have $3,000 in your account, the bank can freeze $1,000 of the $3,000. The bank must give you access to the remaining $2,000 so you can continue to pay bills and withdraw cash as usual. Exceptions to automatic protectionGovernment debts and child/spousal support. Social Security and Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) can sometimes be garnished to pay certain government debts, such as back taxes or federal student loans, and debts for child or spousal support.  Some benefits, such as Supplemental Security Income (SSI), are protected from garnishment – even to pay a government debt or child or spousal support.Paper checks. If you receive Social Security or VA benefits by check and then deposit the check into your bank account, the bank does not have to protect 2 months’ worth of benefits in the account automatically. This means that your entire account balance could be frozen and you’ll need to go to court to prove that it comes from protected federal benefits and should not be garnished. If your bank account is garnished or frozen:If your bank garnishes or freezes any money in your account, you must be sent a notice of garnishment. This notice may explain the court procedures for claiming any exemptions from garnishment and getting your money released. A judge decides whether your money should be turned over to the debt collector based on factors such as the source of your income and any federal or state exemptions.It is very important for the judge to know that your money comes from Social Security, SSI, VA, or other federal or state benefits before the judge decides whether your money should be turned over to the debt collector. You should notify the court, the bank, and the person/business that is garnishing your account immediately in writing, and seek help from a lawyer. If your account is garnished or you have questions, consider finding legal help in your state: You may qualify for free legal help. The Center for Elder Rights Advocacy can refer you to a local agency that provides free legal help to seniors who qualify. You can call the Center for Elder Rights Advocacy at: (866) 949-2372 or visit: Legalhotlines.org. You can also find your local legal services program or attorney referral program here.  Tips:You can use our sample letter to tell a debt collector that your Social Security or VA benefits are protected from garnishment. Check out the sample letter here. If you have other funds protected from garnishment under federal or state law, you can modify the sample letter to fit your situation.Consider talking with a lawyer in your state about other state and federal laws that may help protect your money and other assets from garnishment.Federal and state laws may protect the money you receive from other sources from garnishment. This may include money you receive from a pension or retirement plan, federal student loans, child support or spousal support payments. Other laws in your state may protect some of your money and assets, too. To learn more about how they may be protected, consider finding legal help.  Know when your bank can and can’t charge you fees for garnishment. Your bank can only charge you a fee for processing the garnishment if you have more than 2 months’ worth of direct deposited Social Security or VA benefits in your account.

Under federal law, many money transmitters, banks and credit unions and possibly other types of financial services companies qualify as “remittance transfer providers.” They must generally provide consumers certain information before they make remittance transfers. This includes information about: The exchange rate. Fees and taxes they collect from you. Fees charged by the company’s agents abroad and certain other institutions involved in the transfer process.The amount of money expected to be delivered, not including foreign taxes or certain fees charged to the recipient.If appropriate, a statement that additional foreign taxes and fees may be deducted from the remittance transfer.You also must receive information about when the money will be available, instructions on your right to cancel transfers, what to do in case of an error, and how to submit a complaint.The right to cancel. After paying, you will typically have 30 minutes (and sometimes more) to cancel the transaction at no charge, unless the transfer has already been picked up or deposited into the recipient’s account.The right to have errors resolved. Remittance providers now must also investigate complaints. If you think a mistake was made and promptly contact the company, it generally has 90 days to investigate the matter and must notify you of the investigation’s results. For certain types of errors, such as if the money never arrives, you may be able to get a refund or have the transfer sent again.Other protections may be available to you, depending on how you send the money and the laws in your state.",/askcfpb/1161/what-remittance-transfer.html,APPROVED,Money transfers,Understanding money transfers and remittances | Sending money abroad,,"<Question: 1161 What is a remittance transfer?> | <Question: 1163 What is a wire transfer?> | <Question: 1167 I am having problems with domestic or international wire transfers, remittances, or international money transfers.

1213,"Can my partner, family, or dependents live in my home if I have a reverse mortgage?",,"It depends on whether you’re still living in the home. As long as you still live at home, a reverse mortgage does not change who can live with you. However, if you die or move out of the home, the people who live with you may not be able to continue to live in the home without you.If you are co-borrowing your reverse mortgage with a spouse or partner (or anyone else), your co-borrower can stay in the home even if you die or move out of the home. But if you live with a spouse, partner, children, relatives, or other dependents who are not co-borrowers on the reverse mortgage, those people may be forced to move.The reverse mortgage loan must be paid off when all the borrowers have moved out or passed away. If you are the only borrower, this means that the loan must be paid off when you move out or die – regardless of who else may be living in the home. If you are borrowing jointly, it must be paid off when both co-borrowers have moved out or died. Most people will need to sell the home to pay off the loan. If your heirs would like to keep your home instead of selling it, the loan must be paid off with another source of funds. But they won’t have to pay more than your home is worth. Tip: Before you apply for any reverse mortgage loan, you (and your spouse or partner) should seek housing counseling to help you decide if a reverse mortgage is right for you.Visit HUD's counselor search page or call HUD's housing counselor referral line (800) 569-4287 to find a HUD-approved housing counselor.",/askcfpb/1213/can-my-partner-family-or-dependents-live-my-home-if-i-have-reverse-mortgage.html,APPROVED,Mortgages,Reverse mortgages,,<Question: 241 What happens with my reverse mortgage if my spouse dies?> | <Question: 243 What happens if I have to move out of my home into a nursing home or assisted living and I have a reverse mortgage?> | <Question: 1217 What happens if my reverse mortgage loan balance grows larger than the value of my home?>,Mortgage Complaint
1215,Are there any limitations on the upfront charges a bank can charge for a reverse mortgage?,,"Most reverse mortgages today are insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), as part of its Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) program. The specific costs listed here are for HECM loans.  In addition to HECM reverse mortgages, some lenders may offer what are called proprietary reverse mortgages or ones that are not insured by the FHA, which may have different costs. Here is a list of typical fees that lenders charge at the start of a loan.The Upfront Mortgage Insurance Premium (MIP) is a one-time, nonrefundable charge. The amount depends on how much you borrow within the first year of the loan compared to how much you are authorized to borrow overall. Your lender will calculate for you how much you are authorized to borrow, based on your age, the interest rate, and the value of your home. This number is known as your initial principal limit. If the amount you borrow in the first year is: Your Upfront Mortgage Insurance Premium is: • Less than 60% of your initial principal limit • 0.5% of the appraised value of your home (up to $625,500) • More than 60% of your initial principal limit • 2.5% of the appraised value of your home (up to $625,500) For homes worth more than $625,500, the upfront MIP is calculated as a percentage of $625,500, rather than the appraised value of the home. Origination fee. An origination fee is what the lender or mortgage broker charges the borrower for making the HECM reverse mortgage loan. Lenders may charge an origination fee of up to $6,000 for these loans. For homes worth less than $400,000, the maximum origination fee for these loans is calculated on a sliding scale between $2,500 and $6,000, depending on the value of the home. For homes worth more than $400,000, the maximum origination fee for these loans is $6,000. Learn more here.Real estate settlement (closing) costs. These are the same costs you would pay to take out a traditional mortgage. They include appraisal, title insurance, and inspection fees. Tip: There are no specific limits on these costs, so take the time to get multiple quotes and compare fees.Reverse mortgage counseling costs are charged by the counseling agency, not the lender. Counseling usually costs around $125, and consumers are responsible for paying this cost directly to the counseling agency. Low-income individuals can often get this fee waived, so be sure to ask your counselor if you qualify.Paying for upfront costs. Many borrowers choose not to pay for their upfront costs out of pocket. Instead, many borrowers use a portion of their loan funds to pay for the upfront costs. Example: Let’s say you’re authorized for a $100,000 loan, and upfront costs are $8,000. You could choose to use $8,000 of the loan funds to pay for the upfront costs, rather than coming up with $8,000 from other savings.  However, this means that you’d only get $92,000 of the $100,000 loan amount. Tip: Think twice before deciding to pay for upfront costs using your loan funds. Paying for upfront costs with loan funds is more expensive than paying them out of pocket. If you use your loan funds to pay for upfront costs, you will be charged interest and ongoing mortgage insurance on these costs. This means the total amount you will pay for these costs will be more than if you paid for them out of pocket. Tip:  Using loan funds to pay for upfront costs may be particularly expensive if you plan to take out a lot of money from your loan in the first year. Find out how much you’ll need to pay off any existing mortgage you might have on your home. Compare that amount to your initial principal limit (total authorized loan proceeds). If you’ll need 50-60% of your initial principal limit just to pay off your existing mortgages, you need to be particularly careful about how you pay for your upfront loan costs. Why this mattersIf you borrow less in the first year of the loan, you may qualify for a lower mortgage insurance rate. To be more specific, taking out less than 60% of your initial principal limit qualifies you for the lower 0.5% upfront mortgage insurance rate. If you take out more than 60% in the first year, then you’ll be charged the 2.5% rate.  So, if you can withdraw less than 60% , you’ll pay a lot less for mortgage insurance. Hint: To bring your total first-year withdrawal down to less than 60%, try paying your upfront costs out of pocket.Some lenders may agree to pay some of these costs for you. In today’s market, it is common for lenders to waive or discount the origination fee. Some lenders may also pay some of your closing costs, though typically this discount is only available if you agree to a higher interest rate on the loan. Tip:  Talk to your reverse mortgage counselor about which option is best for you.

1217,What happens if my reverse mortgage loan balance grows larger than the value of my home?,,"It depends on what type of reverse mortgage you have. Most reverse mortgages today are insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), as part of its Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) program. An FHA-insured HECM loan is a non-recourse loan. This means that when your home is sold to repay the loan, neither you nor your family will be required to pay more than the sales price of the home. The insurance will pay for any shortfall, so long as your home sells for at least 95 percent of the current appraised value.If your heirs want to keep the home when you pass away (or move out permanently) instead of selling it, they will have to pay off the loan. But they won’t have to pay more than the home is worth. If the loan balance is more than your home is worth, they will only have to pay 95 percent of the current appraised value of your home. The FHA insurance will cover the rest. (If the loan balance is less than the value of your home, they will only have to pay the loan balance). Tip:  Your heirs may be able to pay off the required 95 percent by getting a traditional mortgage. However, they would still need to meet the usual requirements for getting a new mortgage. These include making a down payment, having a stable income, and passing a credit check. Since getting a new mortgage to keep the home takes planning, it’s a good idea to talk this over with your family.Proprietary (non-FHA insured) reverse mortgage loans are a different story. These may have very different loan terms. So if you have, or are considering, a proprietary loan make sure you understand the provisions carefully.",/askcfpb/1217/what-happens-if-my-reverse-mortgage-loan-balance-grows-larger-value-my-home.html,APPROVED,Mortgages,Reverse mortgages,,<Question: 230 What should I discuss with a housing counselor to make sure I fully understand what getting a reverse mortgage will mean for me?> | <Question: 236 When do I have to pay back a reverse mortgage loan? > | <Question: 244 How much money can I get from my home with a reverse mortgage?>,Mortgage Complaint

1271,Should I request credit reports for my children? ,,"Children under age 18, with a few exceptions, generally do not have credit reports.  Credit reporting companies (sometimes called consumer reporting agencies or CRAs) create and maintain credit files with information about consumers, including experiences with credit.  This information includes how often you make your payments on time, how much credit you have, how much credit you have available, how much credit you are using, and whether a debt or bill collector is collecting on money you owe.It is rare for these companies to maintain a credit file about a child. However, sometimes a minor child can have a file if: A consumer with a similar name as your minor child obtained credit and a credit reporting company erroneously created a credit file for your minor child. An identity thief obtained a loan in your minor child’s name and a credit reporting company created a credit file with information about payment experience on the loan.   Your minor child is an authorized user of your credit card, or someone else’s.Credit reporting companies will not generate a credit report when they know that the information concerns a child.  In other words, if a file about your child exists then a credit report should not be created or provided to anyone requesting the information until your child turns 18. However, you may request all the information in your child’s credit files from the credit reporting companies if you provide documents showing you are the child’s legal guardian. It’s important to review and correct errors in the file now. The information in the file could become visible when your child turns 18 or could be visible now if a credit reporting company has an incorrect date of birth associated with the information. If you notice specific red flags such as receiving bills, credit card offers, or debt collection calls in your child’s name, you may want to check if your minor child has a credit file as a result of an error or identity theft. Identity thieves may attempt, for example, to take out loans using children’s Social Security numbers because children have no credit blemishes and because the thief’s fraudulent activity may go undetected for years.This tip sheet explains how you can check if your child has a credit report, dispute errors, or report a suspicion that your child was a victim of identity theft. It includes contact information for the three largest nationwide credit reporting companies.Credit reporting companies also are required by law to provide access to reports to some minors, such as those in the child welfare system, earlier than age 18 so that they can check for identity theft.

The company may tell you it can guarantee a specific increase in your credit score or get rid of negative credit information in your credit report, even though the information is accurate and current.If you see ads or receive offers to repair or fix your credit, it could be a warning sign if the company:Pressures you to pay up-front fees. The company wants you to pay before it provides any services. A simple rule to follow is “Don’t pay upfront.” If the company uses telemarketing such that the federal Telemarketing Sales Rule applies, the credit repair company may not request or receive fees until it gives you a credit report generated more than six months after the promised results that shows the results. Under the federal Credit Repair Organizations Act, credit repair companies can’t request or receive payment until they’ve completed the services they’ve promised. Some companies will structure monthly payment plans to try to avoid this requirement. You should know that all forms of upfront payment before services are completed are illegal.Promises to remove negative information from your credit report. The company tells you it can get rid of the negative credit information, even if that information is accurate and current. No one can do this.Requests you dispute accurate information in your credit report. The company advises you to dispute all the information in your credit report, regardless of its accuracy or timeliness.Refuses or avoids explaining your rights to you.  The company doesn’t tell you your rights and what you can do for yourself for free. Disputing errors in your credit reports is a free legal right available to you under the Fair Credit Reporting Act; you don’t need to pay a credit repair organization to do it for you. Also, if you have just signed up for a credit repair service, you have the right to cancel your contract with any credit repair organization for any reason within three business days at no charge to you. Tells you to not contact credit reporting companies. The company recommends that you don’t contact any of the nationwide credit reporting companies directly.Credit repair companies are subject to numerous federal laws, including the Credit Repair Organizations Act and often the Telemarketing Sales Rule, both of which forbid credit repair organizations from using deceptive practices and from accepting up-front fees. These laws prohibit many deceptive practices by credit repair organizations. You may have a right to sue a credit repair organization using these laws.  How do I find a reputable credit counselor?Most credit counselors offer services through local offices, online, or on the telephone.

In some states, even a partial payment on the debt will restart the time period. TIP: You may want to consult an attorney or the applicable law in your state before making a partial payment on a debt.In most states, debt collectors can still attempt to collect debts after the statute of limitations expires. They can try to get you to pay the debt by sending you letters or calling you as long as they do not violate the law while doing so. However, a debt collector filing or threatening to file a lawsuit after the statute of limitations has expired may be violating the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.Even if the statute of limitations has expired, a court may still award a judgment against you if you don’t show up and raise the statute of limitations as a defense. Ordinarily, it is the responsibility of the person being sued to point out that the statute of limitations has expired. For example, you may need to show that there has been no activity on the account for a certain number of years.If you are sued, it is a good idea to talk to an attorney. It is important to know you can defend yourself if you believe the statute of limitations has expired on your debts.The CFPB has prepared sample letters that you can use to respond to a debt collector who is trying to collect a debt.

1447,What is the best way to negotiate a settlement with a debt collector?,"Before negotiating a settlement with a debt collector, learn about the debt and plan for making a realistic proposal.","To get ready to negotiate a settlement or repayment agreement with a debt collector, consider this three-step approach: Learn about the debt Plan for making a realistic repayment or settlement proposal Negotiate a realistic agreement with the debt collector Step 1: Learn about the debt.  Any debt collector who contacts you to collect a debt must give you certain information when it first contacts you, or in writing within 5 days after contacting you, including: The name of the creditor The amount owedThat you can dispute the debt or request the name and address of the original creditor, if different from the current creditor.You can dispute the debt or ask for more information from the debt collector. If you are unsure who you owe money to, or how much you owe, it’s usually a good idea to learn more. If you dispute a debt or part of a debt with the debt collector, in writing, within 30 days of receiving the validation notice, the debt collector it is not allowed to contact you again until it sends you written verification of the debtThe CFPB has prepared sample letters that you can use to respond to a debt collector who is trying to collect a debt. The letters include tips on how to use them. The sample letters may help you to get information, set limits or stop any further communication, or exercise some of your rights.If you don’t recognize the name of the creditor, you can ask what the original debt was for (credit card, mortgage foreclosure deficiency, etc.) and request the name of the original creditor. After you receive the debt collector’s response, compare it to your own records. Step 2: Plan for making a realistic repayment proposal. If you want to make a proposal to repay this debt, here are some considerations:Be honest with yourself about how much you can pay each month. Review your debt priorities first, as falling behind on other bills because you are paying off this debt could cause you more problems.Write down a summary of your monthly take-home pay and all your monthly expenses (including the amount you want to repay each month and other debt payments). Try to allow some income left over to cover unexpected expenses and emergencies. A credit counselor  can help, and they often provide services through nonprofit organizations for free. Be wary of companies that claim they can renegotiate, settle, or change the terms of your debt. Decide on the total amount you are willing to pay to settle the entire debt. This could be  a lump sum or a number of payments. Don’t pay more than you can afford. Tip: Don't make a payment on an old debt until you talk to a lawyer. Find out your state’s “statute of limitations” on the debt before making a payment.The statute of limitations is the period when you can be sued. Most statutes of limitations fall in the three to six years range, although in some jurisdictions they may extend for longer.   In some states, a partial payment can restart the statute of limitations on a debt. It can also restart the time period for how long the negative information continues on your credit report. If the statute of limitations is close to expiring, a debt collector may be willing to negotiate with you on more favorable terms. If the statute of limitations has passed, then your defense to the lawsuit could stop the creditor or debt collector from obtaining a judgment. You may want to ask an attorney about the statute of limitations on your debt. To find an attorney in your state, click here. Low income consumers may qualify for free legal help. Step 3: Negotiate with the debt collector using your proposed repayment plan.  Explain your plan. When you talk to the debt collector, explain your financial situation. You may have more room to negotiate with a debt collector than you did with the original creditor. It can also help to work through a credit counselor or attorney.  Record your agreement. Sometimes, debt collectors and consumers don’t remember their conversations the same way. If you agree to a repayment or settlement plan, record the plan and the debt collector’s promises.  Those promises may include stopping collection efforts and ending or forgiving the debt once you have completed these payments. Get it in writing before you make a payment.  TipBe wary of companies that charge money in advance to settle your debts for you. Dealing with debt settlement companies can be risky. Some debt settlement companies promise more than they deliver. Certain creditors may also refuse to work with the debt settlement company you choose. In many cases, the debt settlement company won’t be able to settle the debt for you anyway.

1449,What's the difference between a credit counselor and a debt settlement company?,,"Both offer services to help if you are having trouble making payments on your debts. Credit counseling services to help you deal with debt are different from debt settlement companies in a number of ways: Credit counseling services that assist with debtDebt settlement companies Usually non-profit organizations For-profit companies or law firms Advise you on managing your money and debts and help you budget your payments Offer to arrange settlements of your debts with creditors or debt collectors Reach up-front agreements with your creditors to ensure that the creditors will not pursue collection efforts or charge late fees Often have no up-front agreements with creditorsUsually do not negotiate any reduction in the amounts you owe - instead, they can lower your overall monthly payment Typically offer to pay off your debts with lump sum payments that are less than the full amounts you oweDo not advise you to stop paying your debt, but may help negotiate your monthly payments Usually require that you stop paying your creditors to succeed in a debt settlement program Credit counselingCredit counseling organizations are usually non-profit organizations that advise you on managing your money and debts. They usually offer free educational materials and workshops. An initial counseling session typically lasts an hour, with an offer of follow-up sessions. Note:Although most of them are non-profit, credit counselors may charge fees for a debt management plan to pay off your debt and take those fees out of the payments you make to them. Credit counselors may help you organize a ""debt management plan"" for all your debts. Under a debt management plan you make a single payment to the credit counselor each month or pay period. The credit counselor then makes monthly payments to each of your creditors.Under debt management plans credit counselors usually do not negotiate any reduction in the amounts you owe - instead, they can lower your overall monthly payment. They may do so by getting the creditor to increase the time period over which you can repay a loan (for example, five years). They may also get creditors to lower the interest rates. Although most credit counselors are non-profits, they may charge fees for their services that they take out of the payments you make to them. Debt settlementDebt settlement companies offer to arrange settlements of your debts with creditors or debt collectors for a fee. They typically offer to pay off your debts with lump sum payments that are less than the full amounts you owe. For example, for  every $100 of a loan that a creditor agrees to forgive, the debt settlement company will charge you some portion in fees.While credit counselors reach up-front agreements with your creditors to ensure that the creditors will not pursue collection efforts while you're in the credit counseling debt management program, debt settlement companies often have no such up-front agreements with creditors. Tip: Beware of debt settlement companies that charge up-front fees in return for promising to settle your debts. Warning: Many debt settlement companies will instruct you to stop making payments to your creditors. If you stop making payments, you may face collection efforts, late fees and penalty interest charges. These fees and charges will cause your debts to grow larger. In this way, debt settlement may cause your total debt-load to grow, even if the debt settlement company settles one or more of your debts.If you stop paying your debts, your creditors will likely begin collection efforts and will start charging you penalty fees and interest. Debt settlement companies say that law suits and debt collection efforts are key factors preventing clients from successfully completing a debt settlement program.While some creditors and debt collectors will agree to settlements with debt settlement companies, many will not negotiate how much they will settle for. Instead, they will have standard policies about how much principal they will forgive when you haven't made payments for a certain period of time. This means debt settlement companies usually can't get better terms than you could get by talking to your creditors yourself. Warning:Some creditors and debt collectors will not negotiate with debt settlement companies at all. Once they learn you are working with a debt settlement firm, their collection efforts may become more intense. For example, the collector may file a lawsuit against you.In most circumstances, neither credit counselors nor debt settlement companies can erase all of your debts. Tip:If you simply don't have enough income to pay what you owe, you may consider filing for bankruptcy. Filing for bankruptcy can have long term consequences so consult a bankruptcy attorney to learn whether bankruptcy is a good solution for you.",/askcfpb/1449/whats-difference-between-credit-counselor-and-debt-settlement-company.html,APPROVED,Debt collection,Credit counseling,,<Question: 1451 What is credit counseling?> | <Question: 1453 How do I find a credit counselor? > | <Question: 1457 What are debt settlement/debt relief services?>,Debt Collection Complaint

They do so by negotiating extensions of the periods over which you can repay a loan (for example, 5 years) and by getting creditors to lower the interest rates (for example, as low as zero percent) and waive certain account fees. Tip:If you're having trouble with debt collection, you can submit a complaint with the CFPB online or by calling (855) 411-CFPB (2372).",/askcfpb/1451/what-credit-counseling.html,APPROVED,Debt collection,Credit counseling,,<Question: 1449 What's the difference between a credit counselor and a debt settlement company?> | <Question: 1453 How do I find a credit counselor? > | <Question: 1455 How do I choose which credit counselor is right for me?>,Debt Collection Complaint

1507,What are the new federal protections for consumers who send money internationally? ,The new protections for consumers sending money internationally generally require companies to give disclosures to consumers before they pay for the remittance transfers. In addition there are other important protections to be aware of including a right to cancel a transfer.,"Summary The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has issued rules to protect consumers who send money electronically to foreign countries. These transactions are called “remittance transfers.” The new rules take effect on October 28, 2013.  More details on the rule are available at our regulations page.  BackgroundA “remittance transfer” is an electronic transfer of money from a consumer in the United States to a person or business in a foreign country. It can include transfers from retail “money transmitters” as well as banks and credit unions that transfer funds through wire transfers, automated clearing house (ACH) transactions, or other methods.Consumers in the United States send billions of dollars in remittance transfers each year. Up to now, federal consumer protection rules have not applied to most of these transfers. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act changed that by establishing new standards with respect to remittance transfer and authorizing the Bureau to issue implementing regulations.   Disclosures The rules generally require companies to give disclosures to consumers before they pay for the remittance transfers. The disclosures must contain: The exchange rate. Fees and taxes collected by the companies. Fees charged by the companies’ agents abroad and intermediary institutions.The amount of money expected to be delivered abroad, not including certain fees charged to the recipient or foreign taxes.If appropriate, a disclaimer that additional fees and foreign taxes may apply. Companies must also generally provide a receipt that matches any amounts given in the first disclosure. The receipt also will include information about: When the money will be available at its destination. The consumer’s right to cancel the transfer. What to do in case of an error. How to submit complaints.In most cases, companies must generally either provide this receipt when the consumer pays, or provide all of the required information in a single disclosure before payment is made and a proof of payment afterward.  Companies must provide the disclosures in English. Sometimes companies must also provide the disclosures in other languages. Other protections The rules also generally require that: Consumers get 30 minutes (and sometimes more) to cancel a transfer. Consumers can get their money back if they cancel.Companies must investigate if a consumer reports a problem with a transfer. For certain errors, consumers can generally get a refund or have the transfer sent again free of charge if the money did not arrive as promised. Companies that provide remittance transfers are responsible for mistakes made by certain people who work for them The rules also contain specific provisions applicable to transfers that consumers schedule in advance and for transfers that are scheduled to recur on a regular basis. Coverage The rules apply to most remittance transfers if they are: More than $15 Made by a consumer in the United States Sent to a person or company in a foreign countryThis includes many types of transfers, including wire transfers.The rules apply to many companies that offer remittance transfers, including: Banks Thrifts Credit unions Money transmitters Broker-dealersHowever, the rules do not apply to companies that consistently provide 100 or fewer remittance transfers each year.",/askcfpb/1507/what-are-new-federal-protections-consumers-who-send-money-internationally.html,APPROVED,Money transfers,Sending money abroad,,"<Question: 1167 I am having problems with domestic or international wire transfers, remittances, or international money transfers.

1525,What should I do when I receive a home insurance settlement?,,"When your settlement is paid, the check will probably be made out to both you and your mortgage servicer. Most mortgage agreements require this. Your insurance settlement is to rebuild your home. So the amount may be more or less than what you owe on your loan.Keep in mind that the market value of your home may not match the insured replacement value. That’s because, in some locations, the materials and labor that go into rebuilding your home may be less than the overall value of your property – its location, desirability and other things that go into housing prices. There are also special laws in various states addressing what happens if your home was insured for less than its replacement value. Your state Department of Insurance or Insurance Commissioner may have useful information. You may also need the advice of a lawyer if your claim is large.Typically, your mortgage servicer will release a portion of the settlement money before work begins so you can hire a contractor. When the work is halfway finished, the servicer will typically release more money.

If you don’t think you will be able to pay your credit cards or other loans, be sure to contact your lenders as soon as possible. Explain your situation and when you think you will be able to resume normal payments. Most creditors will try to find a way to work with you. The important thing is to make the call before your next payments are due. Late or missing payments could damage your credit score at a time when you need access to credit most.If your home is so damaged that you can’t live in it, you’ll also want to contact your utility companies and ask to suspend your service. This could help free up money in your budget for other expenses.Take a look at your other bills and set priorities. Your mortgage, rent and insurance payments should stay high on your list.Next, take a look at your income and savings and determine how much you have available.

1529,How do I recognize and prevent against fraud after a natural disaster?,,"In times of crisis most Americans pull together. But some people may try to rip you off. Frauds take many shapes, but the con artists often use a handful of common tricks to manipulate our emotions. It is hardest to make rational decisions when emotions run high. Recognizing the tricks that con artists use, and the effects they have on us, can help you spot scams easier. The best way to avoid scams is to ask questions, lots of them. Asking questions puts you back in control and puts any crooks on the spot.Avoid over-confidence. The first thing to remember is that most con artists are professionals. Anyone can be victimized by fraud. The problem is that most of us believe it will never happen to us. The more overconfident we are, research shows, the more susceptible we are to fraud. The best way to avoid over-confidence is to always be on the lookout for fraud, especially immediately after a disaster or other times of financial stress.Don’t give credibility to titles and uniforms that can be faked. Con artists will often pose as government employees, insurance adjusters, law enforcement officials, bank employees, or whatever it takes to get to your money. Credibility can be easily faked. Always ask for identification. And never give personal information to anyone you don’t know. Also remember that government employees will never ask you for financial information or request payment of any kind. Another common credibility scam is fake charities. These cons use names that are similar to national organizations to get you to make a “donation.” But your money ends up in their pocket. Never make donations over the phone. Make sure you get the organization’s name and contact information and review written materials closely.Don’t fall for “limited time only” offers. Scarcity is common in disasters. But don’t let it get the better of you. Be suspicious of contractors or others offering to move you to the front of the line. Also beware of “opportunities” that force you to make a snap decision. You should never make a decision under pressure. Take your time. Never sign anything without fully reading and understanding it first. And if necessary, ask a trusted relative, friend, or attorney for a second opinion before acting.",/askcfpb/1529/how-do-i-recognize-and-prevent-against-fraud-after-natural-disaster.html,APPROVED,Bank accounts and services,Fraud or scam,,<Question: 1519 What kind of assistance can I get after a natural disaster?> | <Question: 1521 What should I do if my house is destroyed in a natural disaster?> | <Question: 1523 What should I consider when dealing with an insurance adjuster?>,Bank Account or Service Complaint

1545,What should I do if the house or apartment I’m renting goes into foreclosure?,,"If your landlord stops paying the mortgage, foreclosure proceedings may begin. Some state and local laws may offer protections for renters in the foreclosure process. More information about landlord-tenant laws in your state is available here and a summary of state and local tenant protections from foreclosure is available here. Tip: You may want to consult an attorney about your rights. If you need help finding an attorney, you can view this list of resources from the American Bar Association and you can find your local legal aid office or volunteer attorney program here.   Be aware of the following:Look for notices. If notices of a possible foreclosure are delivered to or posted on your property, contact the sender right away and let them know that you are a tenant. You should also contact your landlord.Ask questions. You may get confusing information from your landlord about the foreclosure. For example, the landlord may ask you to prepay your rent in violation of your lease or rental agreement. Your landlord may also tell you that the foreclosure is a “mistake,” or say that the problem has been resolved. To be sure, check with the office where deeds are recorded in the county where the property is located. “Land records,” “auditor,” “recorder” or “assessor” are names commonly used to describe the office where a foreclosure notice or other document (often called a “lis pendens”) has been recorded. You may also want to check court filings against your landlord.Know Your Rights. During the foreclosure process, you need to know what your options are under your state and local laws. They can vary greatly from state to state. In order to decide what to do, you may want to know: How long the foreclosure may take; How much time you have to move after a foreclosure sale; If there are any other specific tenant protections in your state. You may be able to get some of this information by calling the local courthouse. Rent control/Just cause eviction and Section 8. If your state or local laws have rent control or “just cause eviction” requirements, you may be protected from eviction after foreclosure. “Just cause” laws limit the reasons a landlord can terminate a lease or evict a tenant. Depending on the state or local law, the foreclosure alone may not justify an eviction or termination of your lease or rental agreement. If you have a Section 8 Voucher, contact your local Housing Authority and a legal aid lawyer immediately. Usually, Section 8 leases can only be terminated for good cause, which means that you can’t be evicted just because of a foreclosure.  But you may need a lawyer to protect your rights.Utility shut-offs. If your landlord is unable to pay the mortgage, the landlord may also not be paying the utilities, and your utility service may be shut-off. You should immediately contact the utility and the landlord if a shut-off notice is sent or if your utilities are shut off. You may be able to avoid the shut-off by contacting the utility and directly paying them, even if the utilities are in the landlord’s name.Move. Once a foreclosure sale occurs, you may be required to move, often in as little as thirty days or less. You should remove all of your belongings when you move so the new property owner does not take or destroy them.Protect yourself. If someone contacts you claiming to be the new property owner, ask to see documents that show ownership. Do this before paying rent, signing a new lease agreement, or allowing them to come inside the property. Scammers review publicly available foreclosure recordings and may contact tenants living in foreclosed properties to falsely demand rent.Negotiate. If the new owner wants you to move out, ask if they will give you some money to help pay moving expenses. This is sometimes referred to as a “cash for keys” agreement. Sometimes the bank or the new owner after a foreclosure sale is willing to do this.Deposits. If your landlord was not paying the mortgage, it may be difficult for you to get back any money you paid to your landlord as a deposit or prepaid rent. If the landlord did not refund your deposit or transfer it to the new owner after the foreclosure sale, you may need to take legal action  to get back your deposit.",/askcfpb/1545/what-should-i-do-if-house-or-apartment-im-renting-goes-foreclosure.html,APPROVED,Mortgages,Places to seek help | Other mortgage questions,Students,"<Question: 287 How does foreclosure work?> | <Question: 306 I am on active duty in the military or have been on active duty within the past year.

So if the new owner wants to evict you from the property, they can’t do so without a court order.

The landlord is, however, entitled to payment.If you are on active duty in the military and are forced to move because of a foreclosure action against your landlord (because the new owner did, in fact, obtain a court order), the JFTR authorizes the military to pay for your move to another residence near your previous apartment or rental home.The legal assistance office of the Judge Advocate at your military base or duty station can help you to enforce the protections described above.

1567,What is a payday loan?,"A payday loan is a short-term loan, generally for $500 or less, that is typically due on your next payday.","Payday loans generally have three features: The loans are for small amounts. The loans typically come due your next payday. You must give lenders access to your checking account or write a check for the full balance in advance that the lender has an option of depositing when the loan comes due.Other loan features can vary. For example, payday loans are often structured to be paid off in one lump-sum payment, but interest-only payments – ""renewals"" or “rollovers” – are not unusual. In some cases, payday loans may be structured so that they are repayable in installments over a longer period of time. Some ways that lenders might give you the loan funds include: providing cash or a check, loading the funds onto a prepaid debit card, or electronically depositing the money into your checking account. The cost of the loan (finance charge) may range from $10 to $30 for every $100 borrowed. A typical two-week payday loan with a $15 per $100 fee equates to an annual percentage rate (APR) of almost 400%. By comparison, APRs on credit cards can range from about 12 percent to 30 percent. State laws and other factors can influence how much you can borrow and the fees you are charged. Some states do not have payday lending storefronts because these loans are not permitted by the state’s law, or because lenders may choose not to do business in a state rather than abide by the states’ regulations.There are special protections through the Military Lending Act for active duty servicemembers and their dependents who use certain payday loans and other small dollar credit products.",/askcfpb/1567/what-payday-loan.html,APPROVED,Payday loans,Understanding payday loans,Servicemembers,<Question: 44 What is a credit card interest rate?

Make sure you understand: How much would be withdrawn from your account Whether it's the full amount you borrowed or a renewal fee When the withdrawal would occurHow you can revoke, or cancel, your ACH authorizationIf you don't have enough money in your account when the lender attempts a withdrawal, your bank or credit union might charge you an overdraft fee to cover the payment. If your bank or credit union does not cover the payment and the lender can’t deduct the full amount due, your loan will be delinquent. This might result in the lender charging you a late fee, and your bank or credit union charging you a “bounced check” or non-sufficient funds fee as well.",/askcfpb/1569/i-was-asked-sign-ach-authorization-my-payday-loan-what.html,APPROVED,Payday loans,Understanding payday loans | Repaying payday loans,,"<Question: 1065 What is an ACH?> | <Question: 1567 What is a payday loan?> | <Question: 1571 Can I end my ""ACH authorization??>",Payday Loan Complaint

For example, if you roll over a $300 loan with a $45 fee three times before fully repaying the loan, you will pay four $45 fees, or $180, and you will still owe the $300.

1575,What is the difference between a payday loan and a deposit advance? ,"Payday loans and deposit advances are both short-term, high-cost loans. Some of the key differences are who makes the loans, how the loan is requested, and how they are repaid.","Payday lenders make payday loans online or to people who visit their storefront locations. In contrast, banks and credit unions that offer deposit advances generally do so only for their customers who have accounts with them and meet certain other eligibility requirements.A payday loan is usually due to be repaid on the borrower’s next payday, which is often two to four weeks from the date the loan was made. The specific due date is set in the payday loan agreement. The borrower can either return to the payday lender to repay the loan or allow the lender to withdraw funds from a checking account. With deposit advance, banks and credit unions will usually pay themselves back automatically when the next electronic deposit to the customer’s account is made, regardless of source, which could be much sooner than two to four weeks. If the amount of the incoming deposit is not enough to pay back the loan, the bank or credit union will repay itself out of subsequent deposits. Typically, if any loan balance remains after 35 days, the bank or credit union will automatically charge the customer’s account for the remaining balance, even if that causes the account to become overdrawn. Both payday loans and deposit advances charge fixed fees that are usually much more expensive than many other forms of credit. A typical two-week payday loan with a $15 fee for every $100 borrowed equates to an annual percentage rate (APR) of almost 400%.",/askcfpb/1575/what-difference-between-payday-loan-and-deposit-advance.html,APPROVED,Payday loans,Understanding payday loans,,<Question: 44 What is a credit card interest rate?

1577,Is applying for a payday loan online safe?,"Any time you give out your sensitive personal and financial information on the internet there are risks. If you apply for payday loans online, you could be increasing that risk several times over.","That’s because many websites that advertise payday loans are not lenders. They are businesses known as “lead generators,” which make money primarily by finding customers for lenders. Lead generators will collect your information – including your Social Security and checking account numbers – and then send your request for a payday loan to a network of lenders. Your application will then be sold to the lender that offers to make you a loan. However, that may not stop other lenders or other service providers from calling or emailing you.Lead generators might not find you the lowest cost loans, and you should be cautious of sites that promise they will. Many consumers can also be confused about who actually made the loan, which makes getting help when you need it harder. Tip: Key phrases can help you spot a lead generator. It can be hard to tell if the website you click on is a lead generator or an actual lender. Lead generators might disclose that they are not lenders somewhere on their site, but this information can be hard to find. In addition, look for phrases like: “matching you with lenders,” “connecting you with a network of participating lenders,” or something similar, as an indication that you are on a lead generator’s site.",/askcfpb/1577/applying-payday-loan-online-safe.html,APPROVED,Payday loans,Understanding payday loans,,<Question: 1567 What is a payday loan?> | <Question: 1573 What does it mean to renew or roll over a payday loan?> | <Question: 1575 What is the difference between a payday loan and a deposit advance? >,Payday Loan Complaint

If you take out a loan online, the website you visit might not belong to the actual lender. It may belong to a lead generator that will market your loan application to a number of lenders. Another potential difference between online and storefront payday lenders is whether they are licensed to do business in your state, and whether they follow your state’s payday lending laws. A storefront payday lender is likely licensed in your state (although it always makes sense to check with your state regulator) but some online lenders will offer loans to people in states where they do not have a license.

What other options should I consider?,"Before choosing a payday loan, take a minute to think about the costs and all your other options.","First, if you take out a payday loan, you will likely be charged a fee of between $10 and $30 for every $100 borrowed. A $15 per $100 fee is typical. So, if you have an emergency and need $300 today, you would have to pay back $345 in a couple of weeks, assuming a fee of $15 per $100 borrowed. If your budget is already tight, that may be hard to do. The payday lender may encourage you to pay just the fee and extend the loan another few weeks. In that case, you would spend $45 and still owe $345 when the extension is over – that means you’re spending $90 to borrow $300 for one month.If you have an account at a bank or credit union, there may be less expensive alternatives available to you, especially if you have direct deposit or a stable credit history. A credit card or a pawn loan are other options.There may be even more alternative strategies available, including those that don’t involve taking out a loan. Some employers, nonprofit organizations, and community groups offer advances or emergency credit. And don’t forget about help from family or friends. Another option might be to negotiate with the creditor or biller about the debt or bill you owe. A smaller repayment amount at the lowest interest rate will not only help make repayment easier, it may also allow you to start saving some money for the next emergency that will come along.Putting the $45 you would give a payday lender into a savings account every two weeks would add up to $1,170 – plus interest – in a year.",/askcfpb/1583/i-need-money-now-should-i-get-payday-loan-what-other-options-should-i-consider.html,APPROVED,Payday loans,Understanding payday loans,,<Question: 1577 Is applying for a payday loan online safe?> | <Question: 1579 What is the difference between an online payday lender and one with a storefront?> | <Question: 1599 How do I repay a payday loan? >,Payday Loan Complaint

For example, if you pay a fee renewal or rollover fee of $45 you would still owe the original $300 loan and another $45 fee when the extension is over.

First is whether you think the transfer from your account is unauthorized.,"Second, do you want to stop one or more payments out of a series you actually did authorize? Third, do you want to completely revoke (cancel) your authorization? Unauthorized transfersIf you think that your payday lender is withdrawing more money from your checking account than you authorized, you should tell your bank or credit union that you are having trouble with “unauthorized transfers.” If anyone takes money out of your account without authorization, federal law requires the bank or credit union to take steps to stop that problem after you give them proper notice. Stopping a series of transfersYou have some additional protections if your loan agreement calls for you to make regular electronic payments at repeated intervals, such as loans that are repaid through installments, and payday loans that are automatically set up to renew a certain number of times. You can stop one of a series of regularly scheduled payments by giving your bank or credit union oral or written notice at least three business days before the transfer is scheduled. The bank or credit union may require written confirmation of oral notice. They may charge fees for a stop payment. Cancelling authorizationUnder rules that all banks, credit unions and lenders agree will govern electronic transfers, you can also revoke any authorization that you gave a payday lender to take money out of your account. You should follow the instructions in the initial authorization that describe how to tell the payday lender to stop. If there are no instructions on how to tell the lender to stop, then the authorization may be completely invalid – but you should still tell the lender to stop taking money from your account. Specifically, you should say: “my authorization to debit my account is revoked."" You must send these instructions to your lender in writing. You should also keep a copy to take to your bank or credit union. Then tell your bank or credit union that any further transfers are “unauthorized” and you want them treated that way – either stopped or immediately refunded. If your bank or credit union does not follow your instructions, you should contact CFPB.",/askcfpb/1605/how-can-i-stop-payday-lender-electronically-taking-money-out-my-bank-or-credit-union-account.html,APPROVED,Payday loans,Repaying payday loans,,<Question: 931 Can I cash a check at any bank or credit union?> | <Question: 1567 What is a payday loan?> | <Question: 1599 How do I repay a payday loan? >,Payday Loan Complaint

The judgment states the amount of money you owe, and allows the lender or collector to get a garnishment order against you.Wage garnishment happens when your employer holds back a portion of your wages for your debts. If a payday lender attempts to garnish your wages without going through the legal process described above, notify the payroll department at your employer of this and contact your state's attorney general office. You may also contact a legal aid attorney for assistance. Tip: Don't hide from bad news.

1619,Will an online payday loan website find me the cheapest loan? ,,"Many websites that advertise payday loans are not actual lenders. They are businesses known as “lead generators,” which make money primarily by findings customers for lenders. You should not depend on the lead generator to shop around for the best deal for you.Lead generators will collect your information – including your Social Security and checking account numbers – and then send your request for a payday loan to a network of lenders. Your application will then be sold to the lender that offers to make you a loan. However, that may not stop other lenders or other service providers from calling or emailing you.Tip: Key phrases can help you spot a lead generator. It can be hard to tell if the website you click on is a lead generator or an actual lender. Lead generators might disclose that they are not lenders somewhere on their site, but this information can be hard to find. In addition, look for phrases like: “matching you with lenders,” “connecting you with a network of participating lenders,” or something similar, as an indication that you are on a lead generator’s site.",/askcfpb/1619/will-online-payday-loan-website-find-me-cheapest-loan.html,APPROVED,Payday loans,Other questions,,<Question: 1609 Can a payday lender garnish my wages?> | <Question: 1611 I heard that taking out a payday loan can help rebuild my credit or improve my credit score.

1625,My payday lender told me my loan would only cost 15 percent to 17 percent but my loan documents say the APR is almost 400 percent. My lender says the APR doesn’t matter. What is APR and how should I use it?,"The annual percentage rate, or APR, is the standard way to compare how much loans cost. It lets you compare the cost of loan products on an “apples-to-apples” basis.","To calculate the APR, the interest rate and fees are compared to the amount you borrow and extended over a year. This standard amount of time is how you are able to compare the costs of a credit card to a six-month installment loan, or a two-week payday loan. It is also why APRs are often different from simple interest rates.For example, if your payday lender is charging you a $15 fee for every $100 borrowed, that would be a simple interest rate of 15 percent. But if you have to repay the loan in two weeks, that 15 percent finance charge equates to an APR of almost 400 percent because of the very short term.Here’s why: Consider the daily interest cost, $1.07 (or $15 divided by 14 days), then multiply that out for a full year (365 days, so $390.55). So, borrowing $100 would cost you $390 if the term were extended to one year – that’s 390 percent of the borrowed amount.By comparison, the cost of borrowing the same $100 on a credit card with a 15 percent APR is $15 for one year, or about 57 cents for two weeks.You don’t need to worry about the math. Just keep in mind that the APR does matter because it provides a shorthand way for you to compare the cost of two or more loans. And, payday lenders must disclose the loan’s APR and other costs before you sign the loan agreement. Tip: Focus on APRs. If you want to compare the cost of a payday loan to the cost of an installment loan or your credit card, focus on the APRs.",/askcfpb/1625/my-payday-lender-told-me-my-loan-would-only-cost-15-percent-17-percent-my-loan-documents-say-apr-almost-400-percent-my-lender-says-apr-doesnt-matter-what-apr-and-how-should-i-use-it.html,APPROVED,Payday loans,Understanding payday loans,,<Question: 45 What is the difference between a fixed APR and a variable APR?> | <Question: 135 What is the difference between a mortgage interest rate and an APR?> | <Question: 1567 What is a payday loan?>,Payday Loan Complaint

1633,"I’ve paid hundreds of dollars in fees, but the payday lender claims I still owe them money. How can this be?",,"If your loan is renewed rather than repaid in full on its due date, you are only paying the fees associated with keeping the original loan amount outstanding (or unpaid). Renewing by paying just the fees does not reduce the principal amount you owe.For example, let’s say you took out a $300 loan with a $45 fee. When that loan comes due on your next payday, you will owe $345. If you are given the option to renew the loan, you’ll pay a $45 renewal fee, but still owe the full $345 on your following payday. If you keep opting to pay just the $45 renewal fee, you could end up paying hundreds of dollars in fees while still owing the original $300 you borrowed many weeks ago.If you are having trouble paying off your payday loan, see I am having trouble repaying my payday loan. TIP: Consider repayment before taking out a payday loan. Before taking out a payday loan, it’s important to figure out whether you’ll be able to repay the full amount with a single paycheck and still have money left over to pay your other expenses, like housing, transportation, and food costs. If you think you can’t repay the loan when it’s due, you may want to consider other options.",/askcfpb/1633/ive-paid-hundreds-dollars-fees-payday-lender-claims-i-still-owe-them-money-how-can-be.html,APPROVED,Payday loans,,,<Question: 49 I transferred a balance at a zero percent rate and have been paying the minimum amount due each month.

1639,I have a pre-schooler who is starting to ask for treats when we go shopping. What can I do to start teaching her that things cost money?,A good way to start teaching preschoolers about money is have them identify coins and learn their value.,"Adults have a clear understanding that items in stores cost money, but put yourself in the preschooler’s shoes. To them, everything is free. All of their needs are provided. They may know what money is, but they don’t attach value to money. For example, young children will naturally think that a nickel has more value than a dime, because it’s bigger.Dump a pile of change in the middle of the floor and count pennies. Make stacks of five and explain that a stack is equal to one nickel, or that five stacks are equal to a quarter.Talk about things that cost money and things that are free. Ice cream costs money, but playing with a friend is free. Clothes and even gas for the car cost money, but going to the playground does not.Finally, the next time you’re at the store, show them the price tags and discuss how much their favorite foods cost. And, let them watch as you check out. If you pay in cash, let them hand the money to the cashier and receive the change.For more money activities for your child, visit our Money As You Grow section.",/askcfpb/1639/i-have-pre-schooler-who-starting-ask-treats-when-we-go-shopping-what-can-i-do-start-teaching-her-things-cost-money.html,APPROVED,Families and money,Teaching money basics to kids,Parents,"<Question: 1641 How can I explain to my children where money comes from?> | <Question: 1645 What's a good way to get my child in the habit of saving?> | <Question: 1649 When we go shopping, how can I explain that we can't afford to buy all the things my children want?>",Tell Your Story
1641,How can I explain to my children where money comes from?,"When you talk to a child that's three to five years old, you can explain that the money your family spends and saves comes from working.","This may be hard for younger children to grasp, especially these days when most paychecks are deposited directly from your employer and cash comes out of the ATM.Describe the jobs you, your spouse and others in your family go to every day. Walk through the neighborhood or town and point out people working, like the bus driver or police officer.You may also want to explain that some people start their own businesses like stores or restaurants. They make money through profit, by buying goods or resources at one price and charging customers enough to cover their costs, time, and a return on their investment. You could also encourage your children to earn their own money by setting up a lemonade or cookie stand.If you have older children who are looking for more literal answers, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing prints paper currency and the U.S. Mint produces our coins.

1643,I want to help my daughter start her credit history. What should I do?,"To help your daughter start her credit history, start by ordering a copy of her credit reports from Equifax, Experian, TransUnion – the three largest national credit reporting agencies.","You can order the reports free every 12 months at annualcreditreport.com. Even if she’s never applied for credit before, it’s a good idea to order the reports to check for:Mistakes – be sure her personal information like her name, address and Social Security number is correct. Also see if the report contains accounts she did not open or debts that don’t belong to her.Signs of identity theft – like accounts she never opened, that are listed as late or unpaid.If you find mistakes, get them corrected right away. Once you’re sure your daughter is starting with a clean slate, there are a number of ways she can start building her credit. Your credit history starts when creditors begin reporting information about you to the consumer reporting agencies. So some things, like debit card use or paying utility bills, may not build credit. Here are some options you can consider:Secured credit cards.These typically require a cash security deposit. The larger the security deposit, the higher the credit limit. Secured cards are often used to build credit history.Authorized user.You can add your daughter to your credit card account as an authorized user. If you have a good credit record, adding her to the account can help boost her credit score. But, if you have a bad credit history, it would reflect poorly on her too. Also, you will owe the amount that she charges.Store cards.These are cards that she can use at only one store – like a department store – or affiliates of that store. Store cards are typically easier to get than general purpose cards, but they often have high interest rates.Your child might also ask you to co-sign or become a joint applicant with her on a card. Caution: If you co-sign, any late payments she makes will be reported on your credit card too. For more money activities for your child, visit our Money As You Grow section.",/askcfpb/1643/i-want-help-my-daughter-start-her-credit-history-what-should-i-do.html,APPROVED,Families and money,Teaching money basics to kids,Parents,"<Question: 13 I applied for a credit card, but I was told that I had to get my parents to guarantee the account.

1645,What's a good way to get my child in the habit of saving?,"First talk to your children about needs versus wants. Once children understand that needs come first and that sometimes we have to wait for the things we want, it gives them a foundation to see the value in saving. Consider these other tips for children of all ages:","For preschoolersThere are big lessons wrapped up in saving, including understanding the difference between needs versus wants, understanding that needs come first, and sometimes we have to wait for those things we want. Explain that you and your family need food, clothing, a place to live and transportation to get to work. Most everything else is a want. When you go shopping, point out the things that are needs and those that are wants.You can teach delayed gratification – that you sometimes have to wait for those things you want – by using teachable moments, like when your child is standing in line for a turn on the swings, or looking forward to a birthday or holiday.A common method to get children in the habit of saving is to use three jars or cans, one labeled “saving,” one for “spending,” and one for “giving.” Each time the child gets money, a little should go into each.When your child sees a toy they want, don’t automatically say “no.” Have the child look at the price. Then, let them use the money in their spending jar, or save for it using their saving jar. For middle schoolersEncourage middle schoolers to save a dime for every dollar they receive. Help them start a savings account at the local bank, or credit union, or online. Then help them to set a savings goal. It could be the amount needed for a new gaming system, a bike, or car when they turn 16. Whatever they choose, it should be meaningful to them.To reinforce their savings habit, go to the bank at least two to three times a year with your children to deposit their savings into their accounts, and look at how much bigger the balance is on each visit.You might also consider a “matching plan” to help incentivize your child’s savings. For example, you could put in 25 cents for every dollar your child saves. For high schoolersOnce teens reach their freshman and sophomore years, they may be starting to work part-time jobs, which mean more money to save – or more temptation to spend. Help them to focus on attaining their goals, rather than on restricting their spending. For example, many teens’ biggest goal might be saving for a car. Show them the math – how soon they could reach their goal if they saved a specific amount each paycheck or month. You can also explain that the more they save for big ticket purchases like a car the more they can reduce the amount they have to finance and the amount of future income that would have to go to loans and payments. Look at online calculators to run different down payment and monthly payment scenarios.For more money activities for your child, visit our Money As You Grow section.",/askcfpb/1645/whats-good-way-get-my-child-habit-saving.html,APPROVED,Families and money,Teaching money basics to kids,Parents,"<Question: 1639 I have a pre-schooler who is starting to ask for treats when we go shopping.

1647,"I've always tried to save for a rainy day, now my son is away at college and I want to get him to start saving too. What do you suggest?","To encourage your college aged son to start saving, suggest automated savings. If he has a steady income – from a part-time or full-time job, for example – he may be able to set up a payroll deduction from his employer.","He could also set up an automated transfer to a savings account through his bank or credit union.It’s also a good idea to talk about how much he should save. Some experts suggest saving three to six months’ worth of expenses. That’s a good target, but it may be hard to reach for a young person just starting out. Talk about some recent emergency expenses you or he have had recently, like a car repair or repairing a crashed computer. You can use these sample expenses as targets. When these targets are reached, then your son could aim higher.Because he’s saving for emergencies, be sure you talk about keeping the money safe, like in a federally insured bank or credit union saving account. He should also be able to get to the money quickly when it’s needed, so accounts that penalize early withdrawals or that have higher transaction costs, like certificates of deposit or investments, might not be the best options.For more money activities for your child, visit our Money As You Grow section.",/askcfpb/1647/ive-always-tried-save-rainy-day-now-my-son-away-college-and-i-want-get-him-start-saving-too-what-do-you-suggest.html,APPROVED,Families and money,Teaching money basics to kids,Parents,"<Question: 1669 My daughter just got her first paycheck and was shocked at how much was taken out.

1649,"When we go shopping, how can I explain that we can't afford to buy all the things my children want?","When discussing what you can or can't afford with your children, start a discussion about one topic, like groceries, by explaining needs versus wants. Include your children in some of your buying decisions so they understand the choices you make.","First, there’s no shame in explaining to children that you have a certain amount of money to spend on the things you need and the extras you want. Some younger children may not grasp that your funds are finite.You can help your kids to learn that money is all about choices: How much you spend, or don’t spend. Which brands you buy. What prices you’re willing to pay. Whether you shop for the best value or go with the first item you see. A good way to teach these money choices is to include your children in some of your buying decisions. For example:When you’re at the grocery store, explain why you pick one size or item over another. Then ask your children which choices they would make. Try giving your children a few dollars and ask them to pick out what kind of fruit they would want in their lunches.When shopping with your child, ask yourself aloud: “Do I need this now?

1655,"My kids are asking about whether to enroll in their employers’ 401(k)s, what should I tell them?","If your adult children are offered 401(k)s from their employers, encourage them to do it! The sooner they start learning to save for retirement, the easier it will be.","Use the Compound Interest Calculator on the SEC’s website, Investor.gov, to run different saving and retirement goal scenarios to illustrate this point. Start with a fixed goal, like $1 million. Then show them how much they’d have to save each month if they start at 22. Next see how much they’d have to save each month if they started at 42.Generally, 401(k)s include selections of mutual funds. These invest in baskets of stocks, bonds, or a mix of both, and are either actively managed by a professional money manager, or built to replicate the performance of a broad stock market index, like the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock Index.Investor.gov has a lot of information on how to balance a portfolio, and what should be considered.There are also a few things they should avoid. First, if company stock is offered, be sure it’s balanced against other investments in the portfolio. Even if the stock is going through the roof, placing all your eggs in the company basket could be a recipe for disaster. Second, avoid borrowing from the 401(k) if possible. When money is pulled out of a 401(k) it isn’t there to grow. Repaying the loan can also cut into contributions. And, if your kids lose their jobs, the loans would have to be repaid in full or they could face tax penalties.For more money activities for your child, visit our Money As You Grow section.",/askcfpb/1655/my-kids-are-asking-about-whether-enroll-their-employers-401ks-what-should-i-tell-them.html,APPROVED,Families and money,Teaching money basics to kids | Retirement and social security,Parents,"<Question: 1643 I want to help my daughter start her credit history.

1657,Are there activities I could use to teach my child about needs and wants?,"When trying to teach your children about needs versus wants, consider pointing out items like food and clothing as you shop and ask them to tell you which category each fits in to.","Understanding the difference between needs and wants is a bedrock concept that can lead to a lifetime of better financial decision making.Needs include the basic things we need to survive – food, clothing, and shelter. But we also need to earn a living so we can pay for those basic needs and things we want. So, we need reliable transportation and the tools and resources necessary to do our jobs well. We also need to build and protect our assets so we can keep meeting our needs in the future – this includes emergency savings and insurance.Wants are all the upgrades and other things that would be nice to have but aren’t necessary for living, earning and protecting what we have.Knowing the difference is the key to purchasing decisions, and the payment choices that young people will one day face. So here are some activities you can try with your children:When you are out shopping, point out essentials such as food and clothing, and ask your child to describe items that she may want but are optional.

1659,I want my children to learn how to compare prices. What are some things I could try?,"When teaching children to compare prices, focus on both costs and benefits – that is, the best value, not just the lowest price.","These are exercises you can make very simple for younger children and more complex as children get older.For example, when you are shopping at the grocery store, you could hold up two boxes of detergent of different sizes. Have your child find the prices and the amount of detergent in each bottle or box. Point out the unit pricing signs, or do some simple math (or let your child use a calculator on your smart phone) and ask which one they think offers the better value for you. You could do the same exercise online, by comparing toy prices on shopping comparison sites. Here the variables might be the retail price and shipping costs.The idea is to show your child that prices will vary by size, features, quality and retailer, and to let them start forming judgments about features versus cost. Be sure to model this behavior in the store as well. If you automatically reach for a specific brand, ask yourself out loud if it is the best deal. Compare your favorite brand’s price with other sale items. Or, ask your children to find the better deal and let them keep the money they save you.As your children get a little older you could start talking about other products that might be more difficult to compare – a new bike or car, for example. If you will need to finance that car, work together on comparing loan terms and rates. Tip It’s always important to shop for an auto loan before you shop for the car. Get pre-approved before you step on the dealer’s lot. You’ll have a much stronger bargaining position.For more money activities for your child, visit our Money As You Grow section.",/askcfpb/1659/i-want-my-children-learn-how-compare-prices-what-are-some-things-i-could-try.html,APPROVED,Families and money,Teaching money basics to kids,Parents,"<Question: 1649 When we go shopping, how can I explain that we can't afford to buy all the things my children want?> | <Question: 1657 Are there activities I could use to teach my child about needs and wants?> | <Question: 1661 When's a good age to open a savings account for my child?>",Tell Your Story

Consider opening a savings account for your child as soon as they save more in their piggy bank than you feel comfortable letting them have easy access to.,"A good way to introduce your child to banks or credit unions is to explain that we use these institutions to keep our money safe and to receive interest. Even younger children will understand the safety and security part, but you might want to save a detailed explanation of compounding interest, or how our banking system works, until they’re able to get it.If your child asks why banks pay us for keeping our money safe, you can explain simply that banks and credit unions use our savings to make loans to other people. They charge those customers a little extra when they pay the money back, and we get a portion of that. You can also explain that the deposits we put into a bank or credit union are insured through the federal government. Tip: Shop around for accounts that require low initial deposits and no minimum monthly balance. You wouldn’t want your children’s allowances to be eaten up by monthly fees.The next time you go to your bank or credit union, have your children come along.

First, she will automatically receive a standard deduction ($5,950 for tax year 2012 ) and possibly other tax credits when she completes her tax return.We have a progressive income tax structure in the U.S. For example, for the 2012 tax year, single filers paid a 10 percent federal income tax on the first $8,700 of taxable income. The next bracket – from $8,701 to $35,350 is taxed at a 15 percent tax rate. So, if your daughter will have a taxable income of $30,000, the first $8,700 would be taxed at 10 percent, and the remaining $21,300 would be taxed at 15 percent under the 2012 tax rate schedule. The other deductions in her paycheck are more straightforward. There may be income tax withholding from her state. And there’s FICA. This stands for Federal Insurance Contributions Act and is the money taken out to pay for Social Security and Medicare.If your daughter is receiving health or retirement benefits, contributions for these may be coming out too.For more money activities for your child, visit our Money As You Grow section.",/askcfpb/1669/my-daughter-just-got-her-first-paycheck-and-was-shocked-how-much-was-taken-out-what-should-i-tell-her-about-taxes-and-other-deductions.html,APPROVED,Families and money,Teaching money basics to kids,Parents,"<Question: 1271 Should I request credit reports for my children? > | <Question: 1649 When we go shopping, how can I explain that we can't afford to buy all the things my children want?> | <Question: 1659 I want my children to learn how to compare prices.

1671,My son just started his first part-time job. Can he open an IRA?,Your son or daughter can open an IRA as soon as he or she has earned income.,"There are two types of IRAs – the Roth IRA and the traditional tax deductible IRA. The basic difference is that contributions to Roth IRAs are not tax deductible, but you can withdraw your savings in retirement tax-free. With traditional IRAs, you can deduct your contributions in the years you make them, but when you make withdrawals in retirement, the money will be taxed at your regular income tax rate. The better option for young people earning part-time incomes is likely going to be the Roth. That’s because: Young workers are probably in the lowest tax bracket and would likely pay a higher tax rate later in life. The future taxes they would pay on their earnings – after 40 or 50 years’ of growth – is going to be more significant than any tax break they’d get today.Opening an IRA is also a great opportunity to talk to your son about the time value of saving. That is, the sooner you start saving, the easier it is to reach your goals.Use the Compound Interest Calculator on the SEC’s website, Investor.gov, to run different saving and retirement goal scenarios to illustrate this point. Start with a fixed goal, like $1 million. Then show him how much he’d have to save each month if he starts at 22. Next see how much he’d have to save each month if he started at 42.You can learn more about IRAs, their rules and limits in IRS Publication 590, Individual Retirement Arrangements.For more money activities for your child, visit our Money As You Grow section.",/askcfpb/1671/my-son-just-started-his-first-part-time-job-can-he-open-ira.html,APPROVED,Families and money,Teaching money basics to kids | Retirement and social security,Parents,"<Question: 1661 When's a good age to open a savings account for my child?> | <Question: 1663 What should I tell my kids about entering personal information like bank or credit card numbers online?> | <Question: 1665 What should children know about money by the time they are five years old, and what can I do to help them learn?>",Tell Your Story

1679,"My kids are leaving the nest and starting their careers, what should I tell them about saving and investing?","As young adults enter into their careers, talk to them about starting to save early for retirement and the importance of preparing for financial emergencies.","Here are a few discussion points you can use. A great place to save and invest money you earn is in a Roth IRA.If your children have jobs, encourage them to open Roth individual retirement accounts. Explain that interest in a Roth IRA grows tax-free for life. Experiment with different amounts of savings and interest rates. Use a compound interest calculator at investor.gov. Use the ""Rule of 72"" to estimate how many years it would take to double your money. If you invest in an account that earns 8 percent interest, you'll double your money in nine years (72 divided by 8 is 9).Explain to your child that once he starts a job, he may be offered a similar account at work called a 401(k). In a 401k, he can deposit pre-tax dollars through a payroll deduction. Some employers even provide matching contributions. The money in the account generally won’t be taxed until it’s withdrawn.When investing, consider the risks and the annual expenses. Invest in an IRA or a 401(k) as soon as you have some income.Putting all your eggs in one basket can be a risky way to invest; consider a diverse mix of stocks, bonds, and cash. Compare mutual fund costs: An ""annual expense ratio"" of 1.5 percent instead of 0.5 percent on a $1,000 investment could cost you almost $2,000 over the course of 35 years.• Ask about index funds, which tend to have low annual fees. Think about your goals. Attending college? Buying a home in 10 years? Purchasing a car in five? Define two financial goals for the long-term future, and make a plan to achieve them. It's important to save for emergencies.Financial emergencies will happen, it’s only a matter of when. Be prepared by starting a savings account to handle repairs, replacements, sudden trips, job loss, etc.Some experts suggest saving three to six months’ worth of expenses. If this seems too difficult, start by looking back at some recent financial emergencies. Set a savings goal you think will meet your urgent needs.

1683,I want to teach my 11-year-old about compound interest. Is there an easy way to illustrate it?,Compound interest is when you earn interest on both the money you’ve saved and the interest you earn.,"So let’s say you invest $1,000 (your principal) and it earns 5 percent (interest rate or earnings) once a year (the compounding frequency). After the first year, you would have $1,050 – your original principal, plus 5 percent or $50. The second year, you would have $1,102.50. That’s because the next interest payment equals 5 percent of $1,050, or $52.50. Increasing the compounding frequency or your interest rate, or adding to your principal, can all help your savings grow even faster.You can teach compounding using your own change jar and there are lots of good resources on the web. For the low-tech method, dump your change jar out on the floor and tell your children they will invest $1 at 10 percent interest. Then run through a simulation like the one above, calculating the next interest payment on the principal-and-interest total each time.For a visual illustration, you can download this poster (PDF) from The FINRA Investor Education Foundation’s SaveAndInvest.org website. It shows what happens when you save $25 every week in an account that pays 5.5 percent and compounding monthly. TIP: It’s hard to find accounts or real-world investments that pay a steady 5 percent or 10 percent return. But if you want to encourage your child to save, consider adding a matching contribution – say, 25 cents for every $1 saved. That could help boost your child’s “interest.”You can also watch this video by the Financial Literacy Center, a joint center of the RAND Corporation, Dartmouth College and the Wharton School. It’s for a slightly older audience – probably college students – but it illustrates compounding in way that most pre-teens and teens would understand. It uses the rule of 72, which basically says if you divide 72 by your rate of return, you’ll find out how fast your money will double in value. For example, if you had $1,000 that was earning a 6 percent return, it would grow to $2,000 in 12 years (72 divided by 6 equals 12).You can also crunch some numbers using different rates, periods of time, and compounding frequencies, at the Securities and Exchange Commission’s website Investor.gov.For more money activities for your child, visit our Money As You Grow section.",/askcfpb/1683/i-want-teach-my-11-year-old-about-compound-interest-there-easy-way-illustrate-it.html,APPROVED,Families and money,Teaching money basics to kids,Parents,<Question: 135 What is the difference between a mortgage interest rate and an APR?> | <Question: 845 What is the difference between paying interest and paying off my principal?  > | <Question: 1645 What's a good way to get my child in the habit of saving?>,Tell Your Story
1685,Should I use a home equity loan to refinance my student loans at a lower interest rate? ,,"This can be risky.  Student loan borrowers who have built equity in their homes may find that paying back outstanding student debt with a new home equity loan looks appealing, given today’s historically low interest rates, but putting more debt on your home can lead to problems down the road.  Before you take out a home equity loan to pay off a student loan, you should try to look for a student loan refinance product first and see what rate you can get.  You may be able to lower your interest rate without some of the risks that come with a decision to tap the equity in your home.  Here are a few things to remember:Your rate may be lower, but your home is at risk. Interest rates for home equity loans are generally lower than interest rates for student loans.  (Lenders are willing to offer a lower interest rate because they know that if you don’t pay, they have a legal claim on your home.)  If you can’t pay, you could end up in foreclosure.On your federal loans, you are giving up repayment options and forgiveness benefits. Federal student loans feature a number of protections for borrowers that run into trouble, including Income-Based Repayment (IBR). These benefits no longer exist when you pay off a federal student loan with a home equity loan.This may impact your taxes. The interest you pay on a home equity loan could equate to a greater tax benefit for some borrowers, when compared to the student loan interest tax deduction, especially if you have high income and itemize deductions. You may wish to consult with a tax advisor when considering your options.For student borrowers with plenty of savings for a rainy day, a good job, and a solid understanding of the tax benefits, a home equity loan may offer an opportunity to pay off your student loans at a lower interest rate.  But again, there is always a risk of losing your home if you don’t make your payments.",/askcfpb/1685/should-i-refinance-my-student-loan-home-equity-loan-if-i-can-get-lower-rate.html,APPROVED,Student loans,Repaying a student loan | Consolidating or refinancing a loan,Students,<Question: 106 What is a home equity loan?> | <Question: 633 What is Income-Based Repayment (IBR)?> | <Question: 1687 Should I refinance my federal student loan into a private student loan with a lower rate?>,Tell Your Story

While today’s interest rate environment is at historical lows, federal student loan interest rates set by Congress have not gone down on the most common type of loan, the Unsubsidized Stafford Loan. Some borrowers in repayment with excellent credit may be able to qualify to refinance their existing federal student loans with a new loan at a lower rate.  Borrowers considering this option should also be aware of the risks:Look closely if you’re switching from a fixed to a variable rate loan. Interest rates for most outstanding federal loans have fixed rates, which means that you never have to worry about your monthly payment going up when interest rates rise in the future. If you switch to a variable rate loan, know that your interest rate could rise higher than the original fixed rate loan over time. You’ll probably sign away certain benefits if you refinance. Federal student loans feature a number of options for borrowers that run into trouble, including Income-Based Repayment (IBR). Borrowers working in certain professions—like those employed in public service  or as teachers may be eligible for loan forgiveness for certain federal loans. If you refinance a federal loan with a new private student loan, you will no longer be eligible to participate in these federal loan forgiveness programs. There are also loan discharge benefits in the case of death or permanent disability on certain federal student loans. Active-duty servicemembers might also lose benefits on pre-service obligations if they refinance.If you are considering refinancing your federal student loans with a new private student loan, be sure you understand what you’re giving up before making this choice.  In general, honest lenders will warn you about the benefits you are giving up when refinancing out of a federal student loan.  If you have a secure job, emergency savings, strong credit, and are unlikely to benefit from forgiveness options, it may be a choice worth considering if you’re looking to lower your payments.",/askcfpb/1687/should-i-refinance-my-federal-student-loan-private-student-loan-lower-rate.html,APPROVED,Student loans,Repaying a student loan | Consolidating or refinancing a loan,Students,<Question: 633 What is Income-Based Repayment (IBR)?> | <Question: 1641 How can I explain to my children where money comes from?> | <Question: 1689 Should I refinance my private student loan into one with a lower rate?>,Tell Your Story

When borrowers first take out private student loans, many have a limited credit profile and are treated as credit risks by lenders. This means that, for many borrowers, private student loan interest rates can be quite high.Some borrowers who have graduated, obtained a job, and have excellent credit may be able to qualify to refinance their existing private student loans with a new private loan at a lower rate.Unfortunately for many borrowers in this situation, there aren’t very many financial institutions that offer this financial product, but if you are able to find one, here are some things to consider:Look closely at the APR. The monthly payment on your new loan might be lower, but the interest rate could be higher. This can occur because the loan term might be spread out over more years. Active-duty servicemembers should remember that they might also lose rate benefits on pre-service obligations if they refinance.Consider the tax consequences. Your new refinanced loan may not be considered a student loan for the purposes of the student loan interest tax deduction.

Many states require debt collectors to be licensed. Check the information the caller provides you with your state attorney general. Your state regulator may be of assistance if your state licenses debt collectors.  If the caller refuses or is unable to provide you with information about the company, or if you can’t verify the information provided, do not give information or money to the caller or company. Tell the caller that you refuse to discuss any debt until you get a written ""validation notice."" This notice must include: The amount of the debt The name of the creditor you owe A description of certain rights under the federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act You can consider sending the collector a letter requesting the information by using one of the CFPB'ssample letters. You can also submit a complaint to the CFPB or you can contact your state Attorney General’s office.Do not give the caller personal financial or other sensitive information. Never give out or confirm personal financial or other sensitive information like your bank account, credit card, or Social Security number unless you know the company or person you are talking with is a real debt collector. Scam artists, like fake debt collectors, can use your information to commit identity theft such as: Charging your existing credit cards Opening new credit card or checking accounts Writing fraudulent checks Taking out loans in your nameContact your creditor. If the debt is legitimate – but you think the collector may not be – contact your creditor about the calls. Share the information you have about the suspicious calls and find out who, if anyone, the creditor has authorized to collect the debt. Report the call. Submit a complaint with the CFPB or get in touch with your state Attorney General's office with information about suspicious callers.Stop speaking with the caller. If nothing else works and you believe the calls are fraudulent, send a letter demanding that the caller stop contacting you, and keep a copy for your files.You can use this sample letter to write a letter demanding the debt collector stop contacting you. By law, debt collectors must stop calling you if you ask them to in writing. However, telling a debt collector to stop contacting you does not make the debt go away and it does not stop a debt collector from reporting the debt to credit reporting companies or suing you.If you're having trouble with debt collection, you can submit a complaint with the CFPB online or by calling (855) 411-CFPB (2372).",/askcfpb/1699/how-can-i-verify-whether-or-not-debt-collector-legitimate.html,APPROVED,Debt collection,Understanding debt collection | Getting information from a debt collector | Harassment by a debt collector | Lawsuit or garnishment by a debt collector,,<Question: 330 What is a debt collector?> | <Question: 332 Can debt collectors tell other people about my debt?> | <Question: 1695 I?ve been contacted by a debt collector.

1707,"If I co-sign for my grandchild's student loan, can the lender garnish my Social Security check if my grandchild can't or won't repay the loan?",,"Support from parents and grandparents can be critical to college success and there’s some confusion around this topic. Federal student loans do not require a co-signer. A parent or legal guardian can borrow a Direct PLUS loan to help a student pay for college. Generally, PLUS loans are not extended to grandparents on behalf of a grandchild.    You may have been asked to co-sign for a private student loan for your grandchild. Private companies that offer private student loans are not allowed to garnish Social Security checks of co-signers if the borrower can’t or won’t repay the loan.  But, the lender can still pursue you and even take you to court to try to collect the amount due because you co-signed the loan. Keep in mind that these loans do not carry the same consumer protections as federal student loans.

As a veteran using your GI bill benefits, here are a few additional things you should consider: How will your military benefits cover the cost of each school? How will your credits transfer to another college? Will a civilian employer accept a degree from the schools you are interested in? Will you have to take out expensive private student loans to pay for the tuition and fees not covered by the GI Bill? Warning:For-profit colleges have an extra incentive to enroll veteran students. Under federal law, these schools are required to get at least 10 percent of their revenue from sources other than certain federal education funds. Because GI Bill benefits are not considered to be a type of these funds, many for-profit colleges target veterans to satisfy this requirement.Over the last few years, for-profit colleges have marketed aggressively to veterans.

1715,I was offered a pension advance. What is this? What should I look out for?,,"You should be careful if you get offers for pension advance products. These are offers to pay a lump-sum payout to military or other retirees who receive pensions. This payout is made in exchange for all or part of your monthly retirement pension payment. Though you might get a large amount of money up front, in the end you may only be paid a small amount of what you would have earned if you waited to receive your full pension payments. There are many companies making pension advance offers on the internet. Many use patriotic-sounding names or logos. You should always research the terms and conditions to figure out whether their offers will actually help you in the long run.Pension advance offers promise quick money, but the cost can be very high.  We’ve heard from veterans paying interest rates as high as 106 percent.

You might also make investments, pay taxes, collect rent or unpaid debts, and get insurance for her, if needed.Keep her money and property separate. Never mix your friend’s money or property with your own or someone else’s. Confused records can get you in trouble with government agencies, like adult protective services, and the police.

1787,What is the ability-to-repay rule? Why is it important to me?,,"The ability-to-repay rule requires most mortgage lenders to make a good-faith effort to determine that you are likely to be able to pay back the loan. This is important because during the financial crisis many lenders made loans without making sure borrowers had enough income to repay their mortgage loans. As a result many borrowers ended up in risky loans they could not afford. Congress responded by passing a common-sense law that says mortgage lenders must make a reasonable effort to figure out if a borrower has the ability to repay the mortgage before the loan is made.The CFPB is responsible for enforcing this law, and we have written a rule that says lenders have to make a reasonable and good-faith effort to figure out a borrower’s ability to repay a mortgage. In practice this means lenders must generally find out, consider, and document a borrower’s income, assets, employment, credit history and monthly expenses. Lenders cannot just use an introductory or “teaser” rate to figure out if a borrower can repay a loan.  For example, if a mortgage has a low interest rate that goes up in later years, the lender has to make a reasonable effort to figure out if the borrower can pay the higher interest rate too.One way a lender can follow the ability-to-repay rule is by making a ""Qualified Mortgage.”",/askcfpb/1787/what-ability-repay-rule-why-it-important-me.html,APPROVED,Mortgages,Mortgage scams and discrimination | Definitions,,<Question: 1789 What is a Qualified Mortgage?> | <Question: 1791 What is a debt-to-income ratio?

1789,What is a Qualified Mortgage?,"A Qualified Mortgage is a category of loans that have certain, more stable features that help make it more likely that you’ll be able to afford your loan.","A lender must make a good-faith effort to determine that you have the ability to repay your mortgage before you take it out. This is known as the “ability-to-repay” rule. If a lender loans you a Qualified Mortgage it means the lender met certain requirements and it’s assumed that the lender followed the ability-to-repay rule. Generally, the requirements for a qualified mortgage include:Certain harmful loan features are not permitted, such as:An “interest-only” period, when you pay only the interest without paying down the principal, which is the amount of money you borrowed.""Negative amortization,” which can allow your loan principal to increase over time, even though you’re making payments.""Balloon payments,” which are larger-than-usual payments at the end of a loan term. The loan term is the length of time over which your loan should be paid back. Note that balloon payments are allowed under certain conditions for loans made by small lenders. Loan terms that are longer than 30 years.A limit on how much of your income can go towards your debt, including your mortgage and all other monthly debt payments. This is also known as the debt-to-income ratio.No excess upfront points and fees. If you get a Qualified Mortgage, there are limits on the amount of certain upfront points and fees your lender can charge. These limits will depend on the size of your loan. Not all charges, like the cost of a credit report, for example, are included in this limit. If the points and fees exceed the threshold, then the loan can’t be a Qualified Mortgage.Certain legal protections for lenders. Your lender gets certain legal protections when showing that it made sure you had the ability to repay your loan. Even with these protections, you may still be able to challenge your lender in court if you believe it did not make sure you had the ability to repay your loan. Tip:If you have a problem with your mortgage, you can submit a complaint with the CFPB online or by calling (855) 411-CFPB (2372).",/askcfpb/1789/what-qualified-mortgage.html,APPROVED,Mortgages,Applying for a mortgage | Definitions,,<Question: 1787 What is the ability-to-repay rule?

1791,What is a debt-to-income ratio? Why is the 43% debt-to-income ratio important?,Your debt-to-income ratio is all your monthly debt payments divided by your gross monthly income.  This number is one way lenders measure your ability to manage the payments you make every month to repay the money you have borrowed.,"To calculate your debt-to-income ratio, you add up all your monthly debt payments and divide them by your gross monthly income. Your gross monthly income is generally the amount of money you have earned before your taxes and other deductions are taken out.  For example, if you pay $1500 a month for your mortgage and another $100 a month for an auto loan and $400 a month for the rest of your debts, your monthly debt payments are $2000. ($1500 + $100 + $400 = $2,000.) If your gross monthly income is $6000, then your debt-to-income ratio is 33 percent. ($2000 is 33% of $6000.) Evidence from studies of mortgage loans suggest that borrowers with a higher debt-to-income ratio are more likely to run into trouble making monthly payments. The 43 percent debt-to-income ratio is important because, in most cases, that is the highest ratio a borrower can have and still get a Qualified Mortgage.There are some exceptions. For instance, a small creditor must consider your debt-to-income ratio, but is allowed to offer a Qualified Mortgage with a debt-to-income ratio higher than 43 percent. In most cases your lender is a small creditor if it had under $2 billion in assets in the last year and it made no more than 500 mortgages in the previous year. Larger lenders may still make a mortgage loan if your debt-to-income ratio is more than 43 percent, even if this prevents it from being a Qualified Mortgage. But they will have to make a reasonable, good-faith effort, following the CFPB’s rules, to determine that you have the ability to repay the loan.",/askcfpb/1791/what-debt-income-ratio-why-43-debt-income-ratio-important.html,APPROVED,Mortgages,Understanding mortgages | Applying for a mortgage,,<Question: 1787 What is the ability-to-repay rule?

1793,My mortgage lender told me it was exempt from the ability-to-repay mortgage rule. Is this true?,,"It could be. A few special types of lenders are exempt from the ability-to-repay rule. Lenders and programs that may not have to follow the ability-to-repay rules are: Community Development Financial Institutions. These groups are certified by the U.S. Department of the Treasury to provide credit and financial services to underserved populations. The Department of the Treasury has a website for more information on Community Development Financial Institutions. Community Housing Development Organizations or Downpayment Assistance Providers of Secondary Financing. These are non-profit service groups that receive aid from the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to help provide affordable housing in their communities. Visit HUD’s website to learn more about affordable housing programs. Nonprofit organizations that lend less than 200 times a year and provide credit only to low- or moderate-income consumers. These groups have to follow their own written procedures to determine that consumers have a reasonable ability to repay their loans.Housing Finance Agencies, which are state agencies that offer a certain amount of mortgages with low rates for low- and moderate-income borrowers.

1795,My lender says it can't lend to me because of a limit on points and fees on loans. Is this true? ,,"No. There are two things the CFPB's mortgage rules require lenders to do: document and determine your ability to repay the loan.The mortgage rules only stop a lender from making a loan when the borrower does not have the ability to repay the loan. However, some lenders may choose to comply with the ability-to-repay rule by making only “Qualified Mortgages,” which do have caps on upfront points and fees.To make sure borrowers don’t pay very high fees, a lender making a Qualified Mortgage can only charge up to the following upfront points and fees: For a loan of $100,000 or more: 3% of the total loan amount or less. For a loan of $60,000 to $100,000: $3,000 or less. For a loan of $20,000 to $60,000: 5% of the total loan amount or less. For a loan of $12,500 to $20,000: $1,000 or less. For a loan of $12,500 or less: 8% of the total loan amount or less.Under the CFPB’s rules, only Qualified Mortgages have a limit on points and fees. Lenders are not required to make Qualified Mortgages, so they can charge higher points and fees if they choose.",/askcfpb/1795/my-lender-says-it-cant-lend-me-because-limit-points-and-fees-loans-true.html,APPROVED,Mortgages,Mortgage scams and discrimination | Applying for a mortgage,,<Question: 1787 What is the ability-to-repay rule?

1797,What is a “higher-priced mortgage loan?” ,"In general, a higher-priced mortgage loan is one with an annual percentage rate, or APR, higher than a benchmark rate called the Average Prime Offer Rate.","The APOR is an annual percentage rate that is based on average interest rates, fees, and other terms on mortgages offered to highly qualified borrowers. Your mortgage will be considered a higher-priced mortgage loan if the APR is a certain percentage higher than the APOR depending on what type of loan you have:First-lien mortgages: If your mortgage is a first-lien mortgage the lender of this mortgage will be the first to be paid if you go into foreclosure. In general, a first-lien mortgage is “higher-priced” if the annual percentage rate (APR)  is 1.5 percentage points or more higher than the APOR.Jumbo loans: If your mortgage is a first-lien “jumbo” loan, it is generally “higher-priced” if the annual percentage rate (APR) is 2.5 percentage points or more higher than the APOR.Subordinate-lien mortgages: If your mortgage is a subordinate-lien mortgage, sometimes called a second-lien mortgage or junior-lien mortgage, and you go into foreclosure, the lender of this mortgage will be paid only after your first-lien mortgage is paid off. A subordinate-lien mortgage is generally “higher-priced” if the APR of this mortgage is 3.5 percentage points or more higher than the APOR. Example: Let’s say you’re looking for a mortgage loan that’s not a jumbo loan for a new home you’d like to buy. You decide on a mortgage loan from Lender X with a 6.5 APR. Lender X checks this week’s APOR and finds that it is at 5 percent. Since this mortgage will be the primary, or first-lien, mortgage on your house and because your APR will be 1.5 percentage points higher than the APOR, your mortgage will be considered a higher-priced mortgage loan. Why does it matter if I have a higher-priced mortgage loan?If your mortgage is a higher-priced mortgage loan, your lender will have to take extra steps to make sure you can pay your loan back and won’t default. Your lender may have to:• Obtain a full interior appraisal from a licensed or certified appraiser.• Provide a second appraisal of your home for free, if it is a “flipped ” home.• In many instances, maintain an escrow account for at least five years.",/askcfpb/1797/what-higher-priced-mortgage-loan.html,APPROVED,Mortgages,Applying for a mortgage | Definitions,,<Question: 1787 What is the ability-to-repay rule?

1799,I was told I’m buying a home that was flipped and that I have to get a second appraisal. How does that work?,,"If the home you’re buying is considered a “flip"" and you’re getting a higher-priced mortgage loan covered under new mortgage rules, you will have to get a second appraisal. A “flip” is when: You buy a home from a seller who bought the home less than six months ago and; You pay a certain amount more than the seller paid for the home: 10 percent more if the seller bought the home within the past 90 days. 20 percent more if the seller bought the home in the past 91 to 180 days.When you buy a “flipped” home, your lender must pay for a second appraisal of the home that includes an inside inspection. The lender cannot charge you for this second appraisal.Keep in mind that not all flips are subject to this requirement. For example, flips in rural areas are exempt because those areas might have fewer appraisers available. Also, properties acquired from a government agency are exempt.

1801,My mortgage lender told me it was exempt from mortgage servicing rules. Is this true?,,"Maybe. Your lender could be exempt from certain mortgage servicing rules if it is a “small servicer.” Definition of small servicerYour lender is considered a small servicer if it: Services 5,000 mortgages or less each year together with any related companies and made or owns all of the loans it services.Is a Housing Finance Agency, which is a government agency that offers a certain amount of mortgages with low rates for low- and middle-income homes.Small servicers are exempt from certain rules that larger servicers must follow, such as about how they provide billing statements and contact you about your loan. Also, the rule about whether or not a servicer can charge you for home insurance you didn’t choose  applies differently to small servicers.Small Servicer requirements Though small servicers are exempt from certain requirements there are new rules that they must follow. For example, small servicers must: Tell you each time a change in your interest rate causes your payment to change. Credit your mortgage payment to your account on the day they receive it. Provide a payoff balance to you within 7 business days if you request it in writing.Follow guidelines to make sure that you are not charged for force-placed insurance unless it is necessary. A mortgage servicer may make you pay for force-placed insurance if you are not paying for hazard insurance on your home. However, the insurance your lender makes you pay for must cost less than the hazard insurance the servicer would pay for from your escrow account. Respond to your requests to fix errors the servicer made or send you information about your loan in a certain amount of time: Acknowledge the request within 5 business days.Correct the error or investigate and provide you with a reason why there is no error, generally within 30 to 45 business days.Provide the information that you requested or explain why they can’t provide the information, generally within 30 to 45 business days.

1805,What is arbitration and how does it affect my mortgage loan?,,"Arbitration is a way to address disputes outside the court system. A person called an arbitrator listens to each side and decides how to resolve the dispute. If you have an issue with your mortgage loan, some protections that are generally available to you in court, like the right to appeal, may not be available in arbitration.In the past, mortgage lenders would sometimes include “mandatory arbitration clauses” in mortgage agreements. These clauses made you agree to resolve certain types of disputes in arbitration rather than in court. Mortgage lenders are no longer allowed to include “mandatory arbitration clauses” in mortgage agreements. You can’t be required to accept mandatory arbitration.

1807,I got a letter from my mortgage servicer about my application for help to prevent foreclosure of my mortgage. Can you help me understand some of the terms? ,,"When you apply for help in avoiding foreclosure you are likely to come across words and technical terms that may be unfamiliar to you. This is another reason why it’s a good idea to get professional help from a HUD-Approved Housing Counseling Agency. Here are a few common terms you may find when you prepare your application: Loss mitigation Servicers generally work with borrowers to avoid foreclosure because they have a responsibility to reduce or “mitigate” the loss to the investor that can come from a foreclosure. That is why servicers call alternatives to foreclosure “loss mitigation.” Certain loss-mitigation options may help you stay in your home and may also reduce the loss the investor would have if the property ended up in foreclosure. HardshipMost loss-mitigation applications require you to describe the change in financial circumstances that is preventing you from paying your mortgage. This is referred to as your “hardship.” A hardship may be unemployment, temporary or permanent disability, uninsured medical expenses for a family member, divorce, death, or other circumstances generally beyond your control that significantly reduce your income or increase your expenses. When you submit your application, you should explain your hardship and be able to provide evidence, such as a copy of a divorce decree or checks you wrote to pay hospital bills. Investor requirementAfter your lender gives you a mortgage, it may sell your mortgage to another investor. If your mortgage has been sold to an investor and you run into trouble making payments, the investor will determine what type of loss-mitigation assistance is available to you if you file a complete application for assistance. Though the new mortgage rules do not require investors to offer alternatives to foreclosure, most investors do so because avoiding foreclosure can reduce their losses. Tip: You have the right to know who the owner or investor is and how to contact them. Net Present Value calculationInvestors may use a mathematical formula to figure out if they are financially better off foreclosing on your loan or offering you an alternative that avoids a foreclosure. This formula is called a “Net Present Value” or “NPV” calculation. When you apply for loss mitigation, the investor or the mortgage servicer will generally calculate the Net Present Value of the loss-mitigation options that may be available to you and use that information to determine whether to go through with a foreclosure.Tip: Your servicer might say that you are not eligible for a loan modification because of the Net Present Value or “NPV” result. If so, you have the right to certain information that was used in the NPV calculation and you should check to make sure that information is accurate. If you need assistance understanding the NPV calculation you can contact a HUD-Approved Housing Counseling Agency. Trial modificationUnder certain circumstances, your servicer may offer to permanently change or “modify” your loan so that your monthly payment is reduced. Usually, your servicer will first put you in a trial modification for a few months to make sure that you are able make the new payment. If you make the trial payments as agreed, your servicer should finish the paperwork to make the change permanent. Your servicer may not start a new foreclosure (or if you are already in foreclosure, may not complete the foreclosure sale) so long as you pay your trial-period payments on time. However, your loan may still be considered delinquent for some purposes during the trial period, because you are making payments that are less than your regular amount.",/askcfpb/1807/i-got-letter-my-mortgage-servicer-about-my-application-help-prevent-foreclosure-my-mortgage-can-you-help-me-understand-some-terms.html,APPROVED,Mortgages,Places to seek help | Trouble paying a mortgage,,"<Question: 287 How does foreclosure work?> | <Question: 1803 I have been trying to work with my mortgage servicer to avoid foreclosure, but it keeps losing my information or making me start from scratch.

1827,"I was offered a medical credit card at my doctor’s office. If I sign up, how does this card work? Who do I send my payments to?",,"Chances are that you were offered a deferred-interest medical credit card. Medical credit cards are frequently offered by dentists, eye doctors, audiologists, cosmetic surgeons, and veterinarians. They differ from traditional bank credit cards – like MasterCard and Visa – because they can only be used to pay for health care, and only within the network of healthcare providers that accept the card. How it worksWhen you take a medical credit card, you are putting your doctor or dentist bill on a credit card just like if you bought something else with a credit card. The way it works is that the doctor, or a member of the doctor’s staff, signs you up for a credit card. This typically will include a credit check. Once approved, the credit card lender pays your doctor. Now you owe the bank who issued the credit card. You should send payments to the address on your credit card billing statements, not to your doctor’s office. The deferred interest featureThe interest charge on medical credit cards is usually deferred for a period of time. You may be offered a zero-percent or low-interest teaser rate in the very beginning. However, if you make a late payment or you still have an unpaid balance by the time the promotional period ends, then the lender may charge you for all of the interest that’s been building up from the date that you made the charges – only now, the interest will be at a much higher interest rate.  That means you might end up paying lots of interest rather than the zero-percent rate that you expected. Learn more about the risks of deferred-interest rates on credit cards.Your credit card agreementYour healthcare provider should give you the terms of your credit card agreement in writing before you pay for your medical procedure with the card.  It’s important to review the terms and make sure you understand and are comfortable with them. This agreement should tell you how long your zero-percent interest rate lasts. Tip:If you didn’t get a written packet with the terms of your credit card agreement and you still have unanswered questions about the terms of your agreement, ask your medical provider to give you the number of the credit card company. You can then call a customer service representative from that company to answer your questions.

1833,I’m sending money to another country. How can I figure out which company offers the best price?,,"If you send money internationally with a remittance transfer provider, you generally will be given information before you pay about the total amount that you will pay, the amount that the recipient will get, and also the transfer fees, taxes, and any exchange rate. Use this information to shop around from one company to the next. One way to comparison shop is to look at how much money the person at the other end of the transaction will get if you were to give each company the same amount of money to pay for fees and the transfer itself. The company that gets the most money to the recipient is the cheapest. Example: Let’s say you have $100 in your pocket that you would like to use to pay for a transfer to your brother in Colombia, including the transfer amount, plus any fees and taxes. Company A tells you that your brother would get 175,000 pesos. Company B tells you he would get 180,000 pesos. In this example, Company B’s transfer is cheaper.Some websites have information about various companies’ prices for sending money internationally. For example, one site provides information about transfers from the United States to countries worldwide. Other sites provide information about transfers from certain cities in the United States to countries in Central America, Africa and the Pacific, as well as  Haiti. All five websites focus on how much a recipient will get if you start with $200 or $500 to both send and cover the costs of sending money. You might find these or other sources of price information a good starting point for your comparison shopping.Warning: Remember that these websites may be incomplete. For example, these websites may not include all of the companies in your area. Also, these websites may not reflect the exact amount of money a company would provide to the recipient. The amount of money that someone receives abroad depends on fees, taxes, and any exchange rate. Companies might change their prices and exchange rates frequently or charge different prices at different locations or for transfers of different sizes. Also, companies may charge other fees that are not reflected on these websites.

1837,How can I find out what’s in my medical payment history?,,"You should contact the consumer reporting agencies that specialize in medical records or payments. These agencies may supply reports on your prescription drug purchase histories, medical conditions, data from your insurance applications, and data from other sources. Life insurance companies, for example, commonly use these reports to evaluate policy applications from potential customers.Just like with the big three consumer reporting agencies– Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion – you can get free copies of your reports every 12 months from many of the specialty consumer reporting agencies. Keep in mind that not every agency will have information on everyone, and that some consumer reporting agencies may be able to charge you a fee for your report. You have to request the reports individually from each reporting agency. We’ve put together a list of some of these specialty consumer reporting agencies, along with some information about how you can obtain copies of your reports.A consumer reporting agency, including a specialty agency, must also give you a free copy of your consumer report upon request if you have received an “adverse action” notice. Example: Let’s say an insurance company turns you down for a life insurance policy based on a consumer report. This is an example of an “adverse action.” The insurance company must provide you with an “adverse action” notice that includes the name and contact information of the consumer reporting agency from which the insurance company got the consumer report. Tip:You have the right to get a free report from the consumer reporting agency identified in an “adverse action” notice. Review the report to see what information the consumer reporting agency has on file about your medical history. If you spot any errors, you can then ask that they be corrected. Tip:If you have been denied coverage or offered coverage with higher premiums in the past, you should check your reports to make sure they do not contain mistakes.  If they do, you can ask for corrections of any errors in the report.",/askcfpb/1837/how-can-i-find-out-whats-my-medical-payment-history.html,APPROVED,Credit reports and scores,"Getting a credit report | Employment, housing and other specialty credit reports",,<Question: 1813 What are specialty consumer reporting agencies and what kind of information do they collect?> | <Question: 1823 I?ve been looking for a job.

However, depending on the contract or State law, the seller may end up paying for some of these costs.Even if you don’t pay the mortgage closing fees directly out of pocket, you might end up paying them indirectly. Sometimes, you can negotiate with the seller for a “credit” towards your closing costs, but the seller will usually require you to pay a higher price for the home in order to cover the costs of this credit. You’re still paying for these costs—they are just paid through your loan instead of paid out of pocket.  The lender may also offer to give you a credit to help with your closing costs.  This credit isn’t free either. Typically, the lender will either increase your loan amount to cover these costs, or charge you a higher interest rate in exchange for the credit.  Common closing fees or charges may include: Appraisal fees Tax service provider fees Title insurance Government taxesPrepaid expenses such as property taxes, homeowner’s insurance, and interest until your first payment is due Tip: You can get a detailed explanation of all the fees, charges or other costs associated with your loan by checking our “Your Home Loan Toolkit.”",/askcfpb/1845/what-fees-or-charges-are-paid-closing-and-who-pays-them.html,APPROVED,Mortgages,Closing on a mortgage,,"<Question: 141 Is there such a thing as a no-cost or no-closing loan or refinancing?  > | <Question: 176 What is a mortgage ""closing""?

Your servicer’s responseIf your servicer receives your complete application more than 37 days before your scheduled foreclosure sale, you should hear back from your servicer in writing within 30 days. Your servicer may respond to your complete application in three ways: Your servicer may offer you a loss mitigation option. It will also tell you how long you have to accept the offer. This may depend on how long before your scheduled foreclosure sale you completed your application. Your servicer may deny you loss mitigation.

If your servicer receives your complete application for loss mitigation at least 90 days before a scheduled foreclosure sale, you may also have a right to appeal  if you were denied a loan modification.Your servicer may ask for additional documentation or information.

1859,I’ve seen a lot of advertisements for companies that consolidate credit card debt. Are these legitimate?,"Some credit card debt consolidation companies are legitimate, but using such services can be risky. If you are thinking about debt consolidation, you might want to first consult a non-profit credit counselor.","Many people get into debt because they can’t afford to make monthly debt payments on top of paying for daily living expenses. If you’re not sure of the best way to handle your debt, a credit counselor can also help you explore your options. Tip:  You can also reach out to your creditors to see if there are any ways you can lower your payments. Some creditors might be willing to accept lower minimum monthly payments or change your monthly due date because they would rather get paid less on a regular basis – than not get paid at all. You may see many advertisements for these debt consolidation options: •    Nonprofit credit counseling •    Paying back your debt through a debt repayment plan•    Transferring debt to a zero or low-interest credit card•    Taking out a debt consolidation loan•    Taking out a home equity loan Tip: Learn more about the advantages and risks of each of these different ways to consolidate debt to avoid getting into more trouble. Warning:There are many companies that advertise for debt consolidation services, however many may actually be debt settlement companies. A debt settlement company may try to convince you to stop paying your debts and instead pay into a special account. The company will then use this money to attempt to negotiate with creditors to reduce the amount of principal you pay off. Debt settlement is risky for several reasons: Not paying creditors will show up as a negative transaction on your credit report. This could make it harder for you to take out other credit.If you don’t pay your debt, your creditors might hire debt collection agencies to collect your debt. This could lead to a lawsuit.While you don’t pay your debts under a debt settlement plan, interest and penalty fees will be added to the amount you owe. So, even if your creditor (such as your credit card company) agrees to accept something less than the full amount you owe, that amount might have grown anyway because of interest and penalty fees. Tip: If you have a problem with a credit card, you can submit a complaint with the CFPB online or by calling (800) 411-CFPB (2372).",/askcfpb/1859/ive-seen-lot-advertisements-companies-consolidate-credit-card-debt-are-these-legitimate.html,APPROVED,Debt collection,Paying a credit card bill,,<Question: 1355 How do I choose which credit counselor is right for me?>,Credit Card Complaint
1861,How can I safely consolidate my credit card debt?,"Consolidating credit card debt depends on your situation. If you are thinking about debt consolidation, you might want to first consult a non-profit credit counselor.","Consolidation means that your various debts, whether they are credit card bills or loan payments, are rolled into one monthly payment. If you have multiple credit card accounts or loans, consolidation may be a way to simplify or lower payments. Tip:If you are thinking about debt consolidation, you might want to first consult a non-profit credit counselor. Many people get into debt because they can’t afford to make monthly debt payments on top of paying for daily living expenses. If you’re not sure of the best way to address your debt, a credit counselor can help you explore your options. Tip: You can also reach out to your individual creditors to see if they will agree to lower your payments. Some creditors might be willing to accept lower minimum monthly payments or change your monthly due date because they would rather get paid less on a regular basis – than not get paid at all.Here’s what you need to know if you are considering these options for consolidation:  Transferring different debt balances to one credit card accountMany credit card companies offer zero-percent or low-interest balance transfers to allow you to consolidate your debt on one account. This will allow you to make one payment and sometimes will result in lower payments.Warning: Many zero-percent or low-interest credit card offers only last for a limited amount of time. After that, the interest rate on your new credit card may rise, increasing your payment amount. Also, with many of these cards, if you’re late on a payment the credit card company can increase your interest rate. Many zero-percent or low-interest balance transfers are subject to a fee (sometimes called a “balance transfer fee”) The fee is usually a certain percentage of the amount you transfer. In addition, if you use the same credit card to make purchases after you take advantage of the balance transfer offer, you will be charged additional interest on those purchases. Tip:Make sure you understand exactly when the low-rate on your balance transfer will end. Also, understand whether there are any other fees or costs that can increase your payment amount, like a balance transfer fee or additional interest charges on new purchases made with the card. If you want to avoid interest on purchases after you make a balance transfer, you should plan to use a different card for those purchases.Taking out a debt consolidation loan  Many banks, credit unions, and installment loan lenders offer these loans which collect all of your debts into one loan payment. This simplifies how many payments you have to make to different creditors. These offers also may include lower interest rates than you are currently paying. However, if you consolidate your debts and then incur new debts on top of the consolidation loan, you may end up farther in debt than before. Warning:Many of the low interest rates for debt consolidation loans may be “teaser rates” that only last for a certain period of time. After that, your lender may increase the rate you have to pay. They may also include hidden fees or costs that you would not have to pay if you continued making your other payments. Also, because you have debt, you might not be able to get the best interest rates that these companies offer. Tip:Before taking out one of these loans, add up all of your current payments. Make sure you include all of the fees and interest you pay now. Compare these payments with what you would pay if you took out the consolidation loan and make sure it’s a better deal.Taking out a home equity loanUsing a home equity loan to consolidate credit card debt is risky. Although you may be able to get credit at lower interest if you take out a loan against the equity (wealth) of your home, doing so decreases the net worth of your home and could put your home at risk. Warning:A home equity loan could create more debt. If you get into trouble paying it back, you could lose your home if you default on your loan. Tip: Make sure you understand how much you can afford before you take out a home equity loan. Just because a bank may offer you a certain loan amount doesn’t mean you should take the whole amount they offer. Tip: Ask your credit card company about a debt repayment plan. If you get one of these plans, your credit card company might wave late payment or over-the-limit fees or reduce your interest rate to help you pay back your debt.Things to consider If you want to consolidate your debt, there are a few things you should think about: Taking on more debt to pay off debt may just be kicking the can down the road. Most people don’t succeed in paying off their debt by taking on more debt.The loans you take out to consolidate your debt may end up costing you more in costs, fees, and rising interest rates than if you had just paid your previous debt payments.If problems with debt have affected your credit score, you probably won’t be able to get the low interest rates on a balance transfer that would make consolidation worth it. A non-profit credit counselor can help you weigh your options.

1863,My credit card statement now has a credit score. What does this mean?,,"Recently, several credit card issuers introduced programs that provide customers with free credit scores.This credit score could make it easier for you to spot whether there may be a problem or error on your credit report. For example, if the score is lower than expected, you may want to request your credit reports, dispute any errors that you may find, and take steps to improve your credit record by steps such as paying down debt and ensuring that you pay all your bills on time. Warning:Each credit card company uses its own formula for assessing your credit profile. The credit score you get from credit card company X may be slightly different from the credit score you get from credit card company Y. The credit score provided to you by the credit card company may also be a different score than what is used by other non-credit card lenders or finance companies. For example, if you seek an auto or home loan, your lender may use a different credit score than the one provided by the credit card company to assess your credit. Tip: You should continue to get your free credit reports through annualcreditreport.com every 12 months. Credit scores don’t tell you the whole story about your credit record.

You only need to contact one of the three bureaus to place an alert.You can also request a credit freeze, which stops creditors from getting the youth’s credit report until you lift the freeze.

Check the Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion websites to see how much you will be charged, which will depend on what state you are in. To place a freeze, you must contact each of the nationwide credit reporting companies individually.It may also be worthwhile to contact each business that reported a fraudulent charge on the report and request that they close the fraudulent account and flag it to show it resulted from child identity theft.  You may also want to request that they send you a letter stating that the fraudulent charge has been removed.",/askcfpb/1867/what-should-I-do-if-there-is-an-error-on-minor-childs-credit-report-or-evidence-of-identity-theft.html,APPROVED,Credit reports and scores,Disputing errors on a credit report | Fraud or identity theft | Children and credit reports,,<Question: 309 What is a credit report?> | <Question: 311 How do I get a copy of my credit report?> | <Question: 1271 Should I request credit reports for my children? >,Tell Your Story
1869,I’m a caseworker for a youth in foster care. What should I do if there is an error on a credit report or evidence of identity theft for a youth in foster care?,,"There are a few steps you can take: Review the credit report with the youth and verify whether he or she recognizes the items on his or her credit report. Check with your own agency for the name and contact information of your designated point of contact at the credit bureau and what the specific dispute process is for that bureau.To dispute an item on a youth’s credit report that is incorrect, the credit bureau may require the following documents: A cover letter addressed to the credit bureau containing: The personal identification information of the youthA brief summary of the dispute, including an explanation of the error and, if the error pertains to an account in the name of the youth (such as a cell phone), any documentation of the error (such as a bill or receipt that provides evidence of payment) Contact information for the person at the state agency where results should be sentYou may also be asked to provide supporting documents, such as: A copy of the court order authorizing the agency to act on behalf of the youth A certified copy of the foster youth’s birth certificate The Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC) Uniform Minor Status Declaration Form Check with your agency or the bureau to verify which documents are required. Ensure the error has been removed by requesting confirmation from the credit bureau or pulling a new credit report for the youth. Tip:If the error pertains to an account in the name of the youth, it may also be worthwhile to send a letter and all of the above documentation to the company that reported the item (such as the cell phone company) and request that they correct the error and send you a letter stating that the error has been corrected.If you suspect that the youth has been or will be a victim of identity theft —for example, an account or loan has been opened in the youth’s name– you can request that the credit bureau place a 90-day fraud alert in the youth’s file. Fraud alerts require creditors to verify an identity before granting credit, making it harder for a thief to open fraudulent new accounts.You can also request a seven year fraud alert if you submit an identity theft report to demonstrate that an identity theft has occurred. To create an identity theft report, follow the FTC ’s instructions at consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0277-create-identity-theft-report. The young person does not have to file a police report. You can also request a credit freeze, which stops creditors from getting your credit report until you lift the freeze, although in some states there is a fee to lift the freeze. Your state may have additional protections for youth related to credit activity and identity theft. Example: The state of Maryland allows parents or guardians to proactively request the credit bureaus to create a credit record for a minor child and then place a security freeze on the record to protect against identity theft. Tip:You may want to check your state attorney general’s website to see if it has any information about protections for youth in your state.",/askcfpb/1869/im-a-caseworker-for-youth-in-foster-care-what-should-i-do-if-there-is-an-error-on-credit-report-or-evidence-of-identity-theft-for-youth-in-foster-care.html,APPROVED,Credit reports and scores,Disputing errors on a credit report | Children and credit reports,,<Question: 309 What is a credit report?> | <Question: 311 How do I get a copy of my credit report?> | <Question: 1865 How do I check to see if my child has a credit report? >,Tell Your Story
1871,I’m a caseworker for a youth in foster care. How do I check a credit report for a youth in foster care?,,"There are several steps you can take.In order to become eligible for federal grants, a state child welfare agency is required to ensure that youth in foster care who are 16 and older receive a free copy of any credit reports annually and get assistance in interpreting and resolving any inaccuracies in the reports. Here are some steps you can take to find out how to check a foster youth’s credit report:Find out if your agency already has a contract with any of the credit bureaus and if there is a designated person responsible for pulling reports. Child welfare agencies have started setting up arrangements with the three nationwide credit bureaus, Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion. Each of the credit bureaus has established an online portal that caseworkers can use to request credit reports for the youth in foster care under the care of their agency. While each credit bureau has a slightly different system, caseworkers can typically request the information on an individual youth or in batches. Batch requests will pull the reports of a large number of foster youth at the same time. Tip: Check to see if each caseworker must go through a training and certification process to pull reports. Review the process for obtaining the credit reports. Each credit bureau’s process is slightly different and the process may depend on the particular agreement your agency or state has with the bureau.Submit batched or individual requests for the youth’s credit reports to each credit bureau. Alternatively, you may have the option to request the reports through a mail-in (manual) process. If your agency doesn’t have a contract with the credit bureaus to use the online portal, consider this option. The credit bureaus will check for credit reports matching the information your agency provided for each youth. Tip: Some pieces of identifying information are more critical than others.Example: The youth’s name and Social Security number are particularly important, while address may be less so, because the youth in foster care may have changed addresses recently.The credit bureaus may have the ability to run a Social Security number only search. The caseworker or agency must request this report option specifically and not all credit bureaus may offer this.

1875,"During my mortgage loan application process, I was given three or four different valuations. What do all the different valuations mean?",,"A valuation is an estimate of the amount of money a home may be worth. In general, any valuation compares the home you are trying to buy or refinance with sales information on similar homes from the same area.  The valuation will also be based on information about the home including square footage, the number of bedrooms, bathrooms and the year it was built.  Valuations may also use information like tax assessments and sales information for the housing market in your area.  When you buy or refinance a home, your lender will get at least one and sometimes more “valuations.” No matter where the values came from, your lender is required to give you copies of each valuation that they have.  Those valuations could include: An appraisal done by a licensed real estate appraiser who does a full inspection of the property. This is the most common type of valuation. Appraisal values are generally determined by making adjustments between the features of your home and comparable local property sales (which are called “comps” for short).A Broker Price Opinion, or “BPO,” which is an estimate of value provided by a real estate sales professional. A BPO is most commonly used to justify a home’s listing price.An Automated Valuation Model, or “AVM,” which is a computer-generated value that uses mathematical models that compare information about the house you want to buy – number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square feet, etc. - with recent sales figures and other information about the housing market in your area.Your lender may get an AVM when you first submit your loan application, just to make sure that the property value is in the right ball park. Later, the lender may require a full appraisal by a licensed real estate appraiser. Each of these valuations may be different because they are estimates and may be based on different comps or may have been completed at different times or for different purposes. If there is a big difference between the different valuations, your lender will have to decide which value it finds more reliable.  Tip: You may also get your own independent appraisal, but you might have to pay an additional fee. If the appraisal is well below the price you offered to pay, you may want to consider renegotiating the home purchase price or reviewing the appraiser’s work carefully to understand how the appraiser arrived at the estimated value.",/askcfpb/1875/during-my-mortgage-loan-application-process-i-was-given-three-or-four-different-valuations-what-do-all-the-different-valuations-mean.html,APPROVED,Mortgages,Applying for a mortgage,,<Question: 167 What is an appraisal?> | <Question: 192 Do I have the right to receive a copy of my home appraisal?> | <Question: 1799 I was told I?m buying a home that was flipped and that I have to get a second appraisal.

The CFPB doesn’t prohibit servicers from sending periodic mortgage statements electronically, as long as your servicer has your consent.Under CFPB rules, your mortgage servicer is generally required to provide a periodic mortgage statement to you each billing cycle.

1883,What is a FICO score?,,"A FICO® score is a particular brand of credit score. A credit score is a number that is used to predict how likely you are to pay back a loan on time. Credit scores are used by companies to make decisions such as whether to offer you a mortgage or a credit card. They are also used to determine the interest rate you receive on a loan or credit card, and the credit limit. Learn more about credit scores generally.FICO stands for the Fair Isaac Corporation. FICO was a pioneer in developing a method for calculating credit scores based on information collected by credit reporting agencies. Today, other companies also have credit scoring formulas (“models”), but most lenders still use FICO scores when deciding whether to offer you a loan or credit card, and in setting the rate and terms. Banks may also use FICO scores when approving checking and savings account applications and setting the terms of those accounts.Just like there is no single credit score – there are several companies that create scores – there is also no single FICO score. Like all credit scores, FICO scores depend on the contents of your credit report. There are three major agencies that collect credit data -- Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion. Because the credit reporting data at each agency can be different, your FICO scores may be different depending on which agency’s data is used to calculate it. FICO also has different variations of its basic scoring model tailored to different types of lenders (for example, home loans or car loans). So you could have several different FICO scores, even when they are all calculated from the same credit agency’s data.You cannot buy these customized kinds of FICO scores, but myfico.com does make available a score calculated with a general FICO model. Several other companies also provide “educational” scores that might give you some sense of what your scores might look like. Your educational score can be different from the score a lender would use, and the differences can sometimes be significant. The CFPB published a report on these differences. FICO scores range from 300-850. Usually a higher score makes it easier to qualify for a loan and may result in a better interest rate. Like all credit scores, FICO scores can change over time according to your credit behavior. Tip: To get and keep a good credit score: Pay all your bills on time. Apply only for the credit that you need. Don’t use too much of the credit that is available to you.Order your free credit report every year and dispute any errors you find.",/askcfpb/1883/what-is-fico-score.html,APPROVED,Credit reports and scores,Understanding credit reports and scores | What affects credit scores,,<Question: 316 Where can I get my credit score?> | <Question: 317 What information goes into my credit score?> | <Question: 318 How do I get and keep a good credit score?>,Mortgage Complaint

The closing or settlement agent  (known as the escrow agent in western states) is responsible for collecting the money from the parties and paying it back out again according to the terms of the sale and loan.  You’ll need to pay for your down payment (less any deposit you’ve already made) as well as costs associated with the closing. Sometimes the seller may pay costs related to closing to the lender. This is determined by the terms of your purchase contract. The lender provides the funds from the mortgage loan. The closing agent then pays out the price of the home to the seller and distributes the closing costs to the various closing service providers. 3. Taxes and insurance You will need to show proof of homeowners insurance so that the lender will fund the mortgage loan. If your loan includes an escrow account, the account is set up and you make an initial deposit. 4. Transfer of OwnershipOnce all of the documents have been signed, funds have been disbursed and the closing has been finalized, the transfer of ownership occurs. The seller, or a representative of the seller, gives you the keys to the new home, and the closing company, title company, escrow company, or attorney submits the mortgage and transfer of ownership documents to the county registrar’s office to be officially recorded.

You should also review the Closing Disclosure to ensure that the payments are what you expected.

1919,Am I allowed to negotiate the terms and costs at my mortgage closing?,,"Yes. You can always negotiate the terms of the mortgage loan up until you sign on the dotted line. However, your lender or the seller can refuse to agree to any changes. It’s usually easier to negotiate the fees charged by your lender than it is to negotiate third-party fees. Tip: You should always ask questions about fees and rates throughout the whole process. You can ask the settlement officer, lender or closing attorney. Ask about anything that you don’t understand. This is particularly the case with fees and rates.  You should know why you are paying everything you are paying. Make sure you take a list with phone numbers of all of the people involved with your closing (settlement officer, loan officer, closing attorney, real estate agent) in case you have any questions at any time during the closing process. Here are some tips to think about to help review lender fees: Ask for a justification for each lender-charged fee.If the lender charges an underwriting fee as well as a processing fee, ask for details of those services. You may find a fee that can be waived or reduced. Recognize that some items can’t be negotiated. The following items are imposed by governmental authorities: Taxes City and county stamps Recording feesOther items are paid to third parties, and may be more difficult to negotiate. These are fees the lender has paid for, usually at a set price. Appraisal fee Credit report fee Tax service fees Flood certification fees Your lender may also require that you make payments into the escrow account to build up a reserve and cover future payments of taxes and insurance.   Tip:  The best way to get a good deal on a mortgage that’s right for you is to shop around well before you get to the closing table.

1929,"I found out that I can get a student loan deferment or forbearance while I serve in the military, volunteer in the Peace Corps or participate in a national service program. Should I put off paying back my loans until I’m done with my service?",,"Probably not. If you’re short on cash, you may look for a deferment or forbearance as a short-term fix, but you should be careful. These options can make paying back your loans more expensive. This is because you may pay much more in interest over the lifetime of your loan. For borrowers with federal loans, you may also be giving up the chance to qualify for loan forgiveness and other public service benefits.  In some cases, deferment for federal loans can offer special interest rate benefits.  If you have federal student loans and you are eligible, deferment is always a better bet than forbearance, but it may not be your best option. You may still be missing out on other benefits, including loan forgiveness. Some national service programs may offer to help you with your student loan interest once you complete your service, so make sure you ask about this benefit before you decide how to manage your loans.If you contact your student loan servicer and ask for help, they may not tell you about all of the benefits available to borrowers working in public service.  You may want to ask your servicer about them directly. Tip:Before accepting a deferment or forbearance, consider a few things:Most borrowers should say no to deferment and forbearance. When you put off making payments, interest may continue to accrue. This means that once you complete your service, you’ll discover that your student loan balance has grown. You may also miss out on the chance to count your service toward loan forgiveness (see the next tip).Service in the military, Peace Corps and AmeriCorps is ""public service."" This means that, if you have qualifying loans, every month you serve while enrolled in an income-driven payment plan is a month that counts toward Public Service Loan Forgiveness. Under this program, if you make 120 qualifying monthly payments while working for an eligible public service organization, you are eligible to have any remaining balance forgiven on your qualifying loans.Income driven payment plans are the best bet for most borrowers. If you have federal Direct Loans, an income-driven payment plan, like Income Based Repayment (IBR) or Pay As You Earn (PAYE), is the best plan for most people working in public service. Your monthly “payment” may be as low as $0 per month, but you’ll make progress toward loan forgiveness each month you’re enrolled. And, if you have subsidized loans, for the first three years, you won't be charged more in interest than the amount of your monthly payment.You may qualify for other benefits, too. For example, servicemembers may be entitled to lower their interest rate under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA). If you are a Peace Corps volunteer or servicemember, you can qualify for loan cancellation if you have a Perkins loan. Check to see if you’re eligible for these benefits before consolidating your loans – you could lose the benefits, otherwise. Contact your student loan servicer to learn more about benefits for borrowers engaged in service. Tip:Check out these guides for members of the military, for Peace Corps volunteers and participants in national service programs and for other borrowers working in public service. These can help you talk to your student loan servicer and make sure you get on the right path.

1931,My loans are eligible for a deferment because I’m serving in the military or volunteering in the Peace Corps. What does this mean?,,"A student loan deferment is a repayment arrangement that postpones your monthly student loan payment for a period of time.Deferment for federal student loans isn’t generally your best bet. Although members of the military and Peace Corps volunteers with federal student loans can defer while they serve, there are probably better options available. Although subsidized federal student loans don’t accrue interest during periods of deferment, borrowers that chose this option may be missing out on other benefits, including loan forgiveness.  Pay what you can on your private loans. Private student loans may also offer deferment or forbearance for borrowers under certain circumstances. Unlike some federal student loans, you are generally still responsible for the interest that accrues during a deferment or forbearance.  Many borrowers are surprised to discover that their student loan debt has grown once they finish their service and begin to repay their loans. Contact your student loan servicer to learn more about your options before you decide to postpone making payments on your student loans.

They can occur in person, at home, or at a business.Here are some tips to protect yourself from scams:Don’t share numbers or passwords for accounts, credit cards, orSocial Security. Never pay up front for a promised prize. It’s a scam if you are told that you must pay fees or taxes to receive a prize or other financial windfall.After hearing a sales pitch, take time to compare prices. Ask for information in writing and read it carefully.Too good to be true? Ask yourself why someone is trying so hard to give you a “great deal. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.Watch out for deals that are only “good today” and that pressure you to act quickly.

1939,I recently inherited a house. The mortgage lender said it’s required to determine my “ability to repay” before it will let me take over the mortgage loan. Is this true?,,"Not necessarily. If you already have title to the house, the CFPB’s rules don’t require the lender or servicer to determine your ability to repay before it lets you take over the mortgage loan.  Here are some common ways to get title to a house: Inheritance Legal separation or divorce Other types of transfers: Transfers to living trusts Transfers from parents to children before the parent diesJoint Tenancy with Right of Survivorship, when someone who co-owns a home with someone else gets full ownership when the other person dies Other family-related transfersUsually, when someone takes out a mortgage, a lender is required to make sure the borrower can repay the loan. This is called the evaluating the borrower’s “ability to repay.” When the borrower already has title to the house before they take on the mortgage loan, a lender or servicer is not required to evaluate the ability to repay the loan. Tip: You may need to show the mortgage servicer proof of your right to the home. In the case of inheritance, for example, that proof might include a copy of the executed will and death certificate or a letter from the executor of the deceased person’s estate. The documents that will prove the death of the borrower may vary from state to state. Tip:If you need advice for your situation, you may want to get help from a housing counselor.

1941,"On a mortgage, what’s the difference between my principal and interest payment and my total monthly payment?",,"The principal and interest payment on a mortgage is the main component of your monthly mortgage payment. The principal is the amount you borrowed and have to pay back, and interest is what the lender charges for lending you the money.   For most borrowers, the total monthly payment you send to your mortgage company includes other things, such as homeowners insurance and taxes that may be held in an escrow account. You pay a set amount every month and your mortgage company typically holds the money in the escrow account until those insurance and tax bills are due, which could be once or twice a year. If your loan requires monthly mortgage insurance premiums, these will be included in your total monthly payment as well.   Here’s how it works: Principal + interest + mortgage insurance (if applicable) + escrow (insurance and tax) = total monthly payment  If you live in a condo, co-op, or a neighborhood with a homeowners’ association, you will likely have additional fees that are usually paid separately. Tip: Even with a fixed-rate mortgage, your total monthly payment can still change. Although your principal and interest payment remains the same as long as you have the loan (unless you have a balloon loan), your escrow payment can change. For example, if your home increases in value, your property taxes typically increase as well.  When considering a mortgage offer, make sure to look at the total monthly payment. Many homebuyers make the mistake of looking at just the principal and interest payment, leading to an unpleasant surprise when they learn their total monthly payment is much higher. You can find your estimated total monthly payment on page 1 of the Loan Estimate, in the “Projected Payments” section.  Many lenders require you to pay your taxes and insurance in advance using an escrow account, but not all do. If there’s no escrow payment listed on your Loan Estimate, these costs won’t be included in your monthly payment to your mortgage lender. Instead, you’ll have to pay property taxes directly to your state or local government and homeowners’ insurance directly to your insurance company. To make sure you can afford the mortgage, find out what your property tax and homeowners’ insurance bills will be, and calculate the total monthly payment yourself.  Ask your real estate agent where to get this information. Tip: When comparing mortgage offers, make sure you’re comparing apples to apples. If one lender requires you to pay taxes and insurance into an escrow account, but another doesn’t, compare the offers by looking at the principal and interest payment instead of the total monthly payment. Make sure to calculate the total monthly payment as well so you can be certain you can afford it. Note:  You won’t receive a Loan Estimate if you applied for a mortgage prior to October 3, 2015, or if you're applying for a reverse mortgage. For those loans, you will receive two forms – a Good Faith Estimate (GFE) and an initial Truth-in-Lending disclosure – instead of a Loan Estimate. You can calculate your estimated total monthly payment by adding up the principal, interest, mortgage insurance premium (found on the fourth line in the “Summary of your Loan” section), and escrow payment (found in the “Escrow account information” section) on page one of the GFE. If you are applying for a HELOC, a manufactured housing loan that is not secured by real estate, or a loan through certain types of homebuyer assistance programs, you will not receive a GFE or a Loan Estimate, but you should receive a Truth-in-Lending disclosure.",/askcfpb/1941/on-a-mortgage-whats-the-difference-between-my-principal-and-interest-payment-and-my-total-monthly-payment.html,APPROVED,Mortgages,Understanding mortgages | Closing on a mortgage | Maintaining a mortgage,,<Question: 140 What is an escrow or impound account? > | <Question: 1943 How does paying down a mortgage work?> | <Question: 1953 What is mortgage insurance and how does it work?>,Owning a Home
1943,How does paying down a mortgage work?,,"The amount you borrow with your mortgage is known as the principal. Each month, part of your monthly payment will go toward paying off that principal, or mortgage balance, and part will go towards interest on the loan. Interest is what the lender charges you for lending you money.  Most people’s monthly payments also include additional amounts for taxes and insurance.   The part of your payment that goes to principal reduces the amount you owe on the loan and builds your equity. The part of the payment that goes to interest doesn’t reduce your balance or build your equity. So, the equity you build in your home will be much less than the sum of your monthly payments.  With a typical fixed-rate loan, the combined principal and interest payment will not change over the life of your loan, but the amounts that go to principal rather than interest will. Here’s how it works:  In the beginning, you owe more interest, because your loan balance is still high. So most of your monthly payment goes to pay the interest, and a little bit goes to paying off the principal. Over time, as you pay down the principal, you owe less interest each month, because your loan balance is lower. So, more of your monthly payment goes to paying down the principal. Near the end of the loan, you owe much less interest, and most of your payment goes to pay off the last of the principal. This process is known as amortization.  Lenders use a standard formula to calculate the monthly payment that allows for just the right amount to go to interest vs. principal in order to precisely pay off the loan at the end of the term. You can use our calculator to calculate the monthly principal and interest payment for different loan amounts, loan terms, and interest rates.

1947,"If I am considering an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), what should I look out for in the fine print?",,"Adjustable rate mortgages can be very complicated.  There are many parts to an adjustable rate mortgage that can affect how much the mortgage will cost you. If you are considering an ARM, make sure to read the terms carefully and ask lots of questions until you understand exactly how each of these features of the mortgage works. Here are key questions to ask your lender about your loan:When and how often will the interest rate be adjusted?Most adjustable-rate mortgages have fixed interest rates for an initial period –  for example, 3 or 5 years – and are typically re-calculated once per year after that.  But this structure is not required. Some loans don’t have an initial fixed-rate period, and they can adjust more or less frequently.  Make sure you understand exactly how often the rate on your loan will re-adjust. What is the index and margin on the loan?The index and margin control what your interest rate will be at each adjustment for an adjustable-rate mortgage. Learn more about indexes and margins and how they work.What are the rate caps on the loan?The rate caps control the maximum amount your interest rate can change at each adjustment, and in total, over the life of the loan. Learn more about rate caps and how they work.Will the payment be recalculated at the same time as the interest rate? For most loans, the payment is recalculated each time the interest rate adjusts. However, some loans may recalculate the payment amount less frequently. If your interest rate has increased but your payment has not, your loan balance could increase.Can your loan balance increase? Sometimes the balance of a loan can actually increase rather than decrease even though you are making payments on the mortgage.  For example, your loan balance might increase if your monthly payment is not enough to cover the interest on your loan. Check to see whether the balance on your loan is allowed to increase after closing. These types of loans are called negative amortization loans. Learn more about negative amortization loans.Does the loan have a floor rate? If the interest rate adjusts up, can it adjust back down in a future period? Some loans have a “floor rate,” or a minimum rate. Even if the index goes lower, the rate on these loans does not adjust below the floor rate. Loans can also have a clause that says that the interest rate can only ever adjust up, not down. Both of these features can make the loan more expensive and risky for you, by increasing the chance that your payments will go up in the future.   If you are considering a loan with either of these features, ask the lender what benefit you would get for accepting these terms.  Ask for a quote for a similar loan without these features, so you can make an informed decision.Does the loan have a prepayment penalty? Check to see if there is a fee for paying your loan back early. Most loans do not have prepayment penalties, but it’s a good idea to double-check. Learn more about prepayment penalties.

1949,"For an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), what are the index and margin, and how do they work?",,"With an adjustable-rate mortgage, the rate is typically fixed, or stays the same, for the first few years, and then it begins to adjust. Once the rate begins to adjust, the changes to your interest rate are based on the market, not your personal financial situation.  To calculate your new interest rate when it’s time for it to adjust, lenders use two numbers: the index and the margin.  Index + Margin = Your Interest Rate  The index is a benchmark interest rate that reflects general market conditions. The index amount changes based on the market, and is maintained by a third party.  It is these changes in the index amount that drive the changes to your interest rate.  The lender decides which index your loan will use when you apply for the loan, and this choice generally won’t change after closing. The most commonly used index for mortgages is the one-year LIBOR, which stands for the London Inter-Bank Offer Rate. You can look up the current LIBOR rates in major newspapers such as the Wall Street Journal or on financial websites such as bankrate.com.  The margin is set by the lender when you apply for a loan, and this amount generally won’t change after closing. The margin amount depends on the particular lender. Tip: You should pay attention to the margin when you’re shopping for your loan because it can vary a lot between different lenders.  You can also negotiate the margin just like you would negotiate the rate on a fixed-rate loan.  Here’s an example of how indexes and margins work: Let’s say you are shopping for a mortgage, and you are offered a 5/1 ARM with an initial rate of 3.5% percent and an adjustable rate of LIBOR (the index) + 2.25% percent (the margin).     In this case, 5/1 means that the initial rate of 3.5% will be fixed for the first 5 years, and the rate will adjust every year starting in year 6. Learn more about how to read ARM product names.    At the beginning of the sixth year of your loan, your rate will adjust.  Let’s assume that the One-Year LIBOR index is 2.5% at that time. Your new rate when this mortgage begins to adjust will be 4.75%. Here’s the math:  2.5% (LIBOR) + 2.25% (margin) = 4.75% (your rate)  At the beginning of the seventh year of your loan, your rate will adjust again (and every year thereafter).    Now, let’s assume the LIBOR is 3%.  Your new rate would be 5.25%.  3% (LIBOR) + 2.25% (margin) = 5.25% (your rate)  With this loan, whenever the one-year LIBOR index is higher than 1.25%, you will have a higher interest rate than your original rate.  Tip:Most adjustable-rate loans also include caps that limit how much the rate can increase at a given adjustment interval, even if the index has changed by more. Learn more about rate caps.

1951,"With an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), what are rate caps and how do they work?",,"Adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) typically include several kinds of caps that control how your interest rate can adjust.   There are three kinds of caps:Initial adjustment cap. This cap says how much the interest rate can increase the first time it adjusts after the fixed-rate period expires. It’s common for this cap to be either two or five percent – meaning that at the first rate change, the new rate can’t be more than two (or five) percentage points higher than the initial rate during the fixed-rate period.Subsequent adjustment cap. This cap says how much the interest rate can increase in the adjustment periods that follow. This cap is most commonly two percent, meaning that the new rate can’t be more than two percentage points higher than the previous rate.Lifetime adjustment cap. This cap says how much the interest rate can increase in total, over the life of the loan. This cap is most commonly five percent, meaning that the rate can never be five percentage points higher than the initial rate. However, some lenders may have a higher cap. Tip: Compare rate caps when comparing ARMs. Two different lenders may have the same initial interest rate but offer different rate caps. Even if you think you’ll move or refinance before the adjustable period starts, it’s a good idea to know how much your rate can change. Tip: Ask the lender to calculate the highest payment you may ever have to pay on the loan you are considering. You can also find this information on your Truth-in-Lending disclosure, which lenders are required to provide you within three business days after you apply for a loan.

1953,What is mortgage insurance and how does it work?,"Mortgage insurance lowers the risk to the lender of making a loan to you, so you can qualify for a loan that you might not otherwise be able to get.","Typically, borrowers making a down payment of less than 20 percent of the purchase price of the home will need to pay for mortgage insurance. Mortgage insurance lowers the risk to the lender of making a loan to you, so you can qualify for a loan that you might not otherwise be able to get. But, it increases the cost of your loan. If you are required to pay mortgage insurance, it will be included in your total monthly payment that you make to your lender, your costs at closing, or both. Warning: Mortgage insurance, no matter what kind, protects the lender –  not you –  in the event that you fall behind on your payments. If you fall behind, your credit score may suffer and you can lose your home through foreclosure.There are several different kinds of loans available to borrowers with low down payments. Depending on what kind of loan you get, you’ll pay for mortgage insurance in different ways:  If you get a conventional loan, your lender will arrange for mortgage insurance with a private company. Private mortgage insurance rates vary by down payment amount and credit score but are generally cheaper than FHA rates for borrowers with good credit. Most private mortgage insurance is paid monthly, with little or no initial payment required at closing.  If you get a Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loan, your mortgage insurance premiums are paid to the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). FHA mortgage insurance is required for all FHA loans.  It costs the same no matter your credit score, with only a slight increase in price for down payments less than five percent. FHA mortgage insurance includes both an upfront cost, paid as part of your closing costs, and a monthly cost, included in your monthly payment.  If you don’t have enough cash on hand to pay the upfront fee, you are allowed to roll the fee into your mortgage instead of paying it out of pocket.  If you do this, your loan amount and the overall cost of your loan will increase.  If you get a US Department of Agriculture (USDA) loan, the program is similar to the Federal Housing Administration, but typically cheaper. You’ll pay for the insurance both at closing and as part of your monthly payment.  Like with FHA loans, you can roll the upfront portion of the insurance premium into your mortgage instead of paying it out of pocket, but doing so increases both your loan amount and your overall costs.  If you get a Department of Veterans’ Affairs (VA) loan,  the VA guarantee replaces mortgage insurance, and functions similarly.  With VA loans, there is no monthly mortgage insurance premium. However, you will pay an upfront “funding fee.” The amount of that fee varies based on: Your type of military service Your down payment amount Your disability status Whether you’re buying a home or refinancingWhether this is your first VA loan, or you’ve had a VA loan beforeLike with FHA and USDA loans, you can roll the upfront fee into your mortgage instead of paying it out of pocket, but doing so increases both your loan amount and your overall costs. Tip: Once you’ve paid off some of your loan, you may be eligible to cancel your mortgage insurance. If you are able to cancel, you won’t have to pay the monthly cost. Learn more about cancelling your mortgage insurance.    Warning: As an alternative to mortgage insurance, some lenders may offer what is known as a “piggyback” second mortgage. This option may be marketed as being cheaper for the borrower, but that doesn’t necessarily mean it is. Always compare the total cost before making a final decision.

1955,What is a “piggyback” second mortgage?,,"A “piggyback” second mortgage is a home equity loan or home equity line of credit (HELOC) that is made at the same time as your main mortgage. Its purpose is to allow borrowers with low down payment savings to borrow additional money in order to qualify for a main mortgage without paying for private mortgage insurance.   Typically, borrowers with a down payment less than 20 percent of the home’s price will need to pay for mortgage insurance. For example, a borrower that can afford a 10 percent down payment would typically pay for the first 10 percent of the home’s price with their down payment, and the remaining 90 percent of the price with a mortgage that requires mortgage insurance.   When using a “piggyback” mortgage, lenders structure the loans differently.  For example, the same borrower might pay for the home with: a 10 percent down payment, 80 percent main mortgage, and a 10 percent “piggyback” second mortgage. In this scenario, the borrower is still borrowing 90 percent of the value of the home, but the main mortgage is only 80 percent.  The “piggyback” second mortgage typically carries a higher interest rate, which is also often adjustable. These programs are offered under a variety of lender-specific brand names, but follow the same basic structure.  The “piggyback” structure was common during the mortgage boom in the early to mid-2000s. It is rare today, but could return. Under the rules during the mortgage boom, borrowers did not have to pay for mortgage insurance with an 80 percent main mortgage.     Tip: If you’re considering a piggyback mortgage, here are some questions to ask yourself:Is the piggyback structure really cheaper? Consider the cost of both the main mortgage and the piggyback mortgage. Ask to see a quote for the same loan structured as a single loan with mortgage insurance, and compare total costs.Will the piggyback structure make it more difficult to refinance your mortgage later? It can be trickier to refinance a mortgage if you also have a second mortgage, because the second mortgage lender has to agree to the refinance (unless you are able to pay off the second mortgage with your refinance loan).  Getting two lenders to agree to a refinance can be particularly difficult if your home value has declined or if you are behind on your payments and need a loan modification. It may also be harder to sell your home and pay off your mortgages if the value of the home has declined.

1957,What is a prepayment penalty?,,"A prepayment penalty is a fee charged by your lender when you pay off your mortgage early.

Typically, a prepayment penalty only applies if you pay off the entire mortgage balance – for example, because you sold your home or are refinancing your mortgage –  within a specific number of years (usually three or five years). In some cases, a prepayment penalty could apply if you pay off a large amount of your mortgage all at once.  Prepayment penalties do not normally apply if you pay extra principal on your mortgage in small chunks at a time -but it’s always a good idea to double check with the lender. Tip: If a loan you are considering has a prepayment penalty, make sure to read the fine print carefully.

In late 2008, following the financial crisis, the U.S. government took over operations at both companies.   Loan guarantees from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac reduce risk for lenders who make loans and investors who might purchase them.  This makes loans more affordable and contributes to the availability of 30-year fixed-rate loans. Loans that are not eligible for Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac guarantees are typically more expensive.  Loans guaranteed by the GSEs are known as conventional  loans. To qualify, these loans must meet certain criteria. Some requirements are established by government regulation (for example, maximum loan amounts), while others are set by the companies.",/askcfpb/1959/what-are-fannie-mae-and-freddie-mac.html,APPROVED,Mortgages,Definitions,,"<Question: 1951 With an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), what are rate caps and how do they work?> | <Question: 1965 How do mortgage lenders calculate monthly payments?>",Owning a Home
1961,How can I find the loan limit for a conforming loan in my county?,,"You can check the loan limit for a conforming mortgage loan in your county on the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)’s website. Knowing the loan limit is helpful when shopping for homes and negotiating with sellers, so you can know whether a particular home might require you to make a higher down payment or get a jumbo loan instead. Tip:To use this tool, choose your state from the drop-down menu, type in your county, and change the “Limit Type” drop-down to “Fannie/Freddie.” Leave all of the other inputs alone and click “send.” In the resulting table, the number in the “One-Family” column is the conforming loan limit in your county.  A conforming loan is one that can be guaranteed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, also known as the government sponsored enterprises (GSEs).   By law, the GSEs are only allowed to guarantee loans up to a certain amount. In most counties, that limit is $417,000 for a single-family home or condo.   In some counties where home prices are particularly high, there are higher loan limits. These loans are known as “conforming jumbo” loans because they are part of the conforming program, but the loan limit is higher.    Loan limits are also higher if you are purchasing a home with multiple units (for example, a duplex in where you plan to live in one unit and rent the other unit out). The building must have no more than four units and you must purchase the entire building to be eligible (if you’re buying just one unit in a condo building, the regular loan limits apply).

1965,How do mortgage lenders calculate monthly payments?,,"For most mortgages, lenders calculate your principal and interest payment using a standard mathematical formula and the terms and requirements for your loan. Fixed-rate mortgageA typical fixed-rate mortgage is calculated so that if you keep the loan for the full loan term – for example, 30 years – and make all of your payments, you will precisely pay off the loan at the end of the loan term. Learn more about how this works.    The payment depends on the loan amount, the loan term, and the interest rate.  You can use our calculator to calculate the monthly principal and interest payment for different scenarios.  Balloon loan A balloon loan has a much shorter loan term than a regular mortgage – typically only five years – but the monthly payments are calculated as if the loan was going to last for a much longer time, typically 30 years.  Because the monthly payments aren’t high enough to pay off the full loan, the remaining loan balance is due as one large final payment (known as the “balloon” payment) at the end of the loan term.    So, for example, if you had a mortgage loan of $100,000 for 30 years at an interest rate of four percent, your monthly principal and interest payment would be $477 per month.  With a regular 30-year loan you would make this payment for 30 years.  With a five-year balloon loan you would make this payment for five years and then owe the balance of the loan – or $90,448 – at the end of the fifth year.  Adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) If you have an adjustable-rate loan, your initial payments are calculated assuming that your initial interest rate remains the same for the entire loan term.  When your interest rate adjusts, your payment will typically (though not always) be re-calculated based on the new interest rate and the remaining loan term. Tip: The total monthly payment you send to your mortgage company is often higher than the principal and interest payment explained here.  The total monthly payment often includes other things, such as homeowners insurance and taxes. Learn more.  Tip:If you have a problem with your mortgage, you can submit a complaint to the CFPB online or by calling (855) 411-CFPB (2372). Tip:If you’re behind on your mortgage, or having a hard time making payments, you can call the CFPB at (855) 411-CFPB (2372) to be connected to a HUD-approved housing counselor today.

The Closing Disclosure is a new form.  For most kinds of mortgages, borrowers who apply for a loan on or after October 3, 2015 will receive a Closing Disclosure. The lender is required to give you the Closing Disclosure at least three business days before you close on the mortgage loan.

1989,My loan officer said that I need to express my “Intent to Proceed” in order for my mortgage loan application to move forward. What does that mean?,,"It is a good idea to request Loan Estimates from three or more lenders and compare them to determine which loan offer is best for you. The Loan Estimate is a new form that goes into effect on October 3, 2015. After you receive your Loan Estimates, it’s up to you to decide whether to move forward with a mortgage application. If you decide not to proceed with an application for a particular loan, you don’t need to do anything further. If you do not communicate further with the lender, the lender will most likely close out your application.  If you do intend to proceed with a particular mortgage application, you must take the next step and tell the lender you want to move forward with the application for that loan. The lender is required to honor the terms of the Loan Estimate for only 10 business days. If you decide to move forward more than 10 business days after you receive a Loan Estimate, the lender can revise the terms and estimated costs and provide you with a revised Loan Estimate.   The lender cannot assume that silence means you intend to proceed. When you first receive a Loan Estimate, find out what the lender’s requirements are for proceeding with a loan application. After you have reviewed and compared Loan Estimates, make sure you take the next step of notifying the lender within 10 business days if you want to proceed with a loan application. Ask questions if any of the steps or information is unclear. Once you’ve notified the lender, you typically then need to pay an application or appraisal fee and provide full supporting documentation of your income, assets, and other financial information. If you delay providing documentation or other items necessary to move your loan application forward, your lender may need to delay your closing. For example, documentation of your income and assets is typically needed to approve your loan, so you’ll want to send that information to the lender you have chosen as soon as possible.A delayed closing can be costly – your rate lock could expire. If your purchase contract specifies that you must close within a certain timeframe, you could risk losing the home and the deposit you gave the seller. So be sure to send requested information to your lender as soon as possible.

The calculation assumes that you will make all your payments as scheduled.  The calculation also assumes that you will keep the loan for the entire loan term.For example, if you have a $100,000 loan and your TIP is 50 percent, that means that you will pay a total of $50,000 in interest over the life of the loan, in addition to repaying the $100,000 that you borrowed.  If your TIP is 100 percent, that would mean that you will pay $100,000 in interest (100 percent of the $100,000 loan amount) over the life of the loan. You can find the TIP for your loan on page 3 of your Loan Estimate or page 5 of your Closing Disclosure. The TIP is most useful as a comparison point between different Loan Estimates. The Loan Estimate and Closing Disclosure are new forms that go into effect on October 3, 2015. If your Loan Estimate is for an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), the TIP is calculated using current interest rates. The actual amount you pay could be more or less, depending on how rates change in the future. Tip:The TIP does not include upfront fees. One loan may have a lower TIP but higher fees than another loan. The Annual Percentage Interest Rate (APR), by contrast, includes upfront fees.  Make sure to consider all the costs before choosing a loan.   Tip:The TIP is not the same as your interest rate, and it is not the same as the APR.  The TIP will usually be much larger than either the interest rate or the APR.  This is because the TIP is based on the total interest you would pay over the full term of the mortgage, while the interest rate and APR are annual rates.  A $100,000 loan with a 4 percent fixed interest rate, for example, could have an APR of 4.25 percent and a TIP of 72 percent. Both numbers tell you something useful about what you will pay. Tip:Our Owning a Home site has more information, tools, and resources for homebuyers. Note:  You won’t receive a Loan Estimate or Closing Disclosure if you applied for a mortgage prior to October 3, 2015, or if you're applying for a reverse mortgage. For those loans , you will receive two forms – a Good Faith Estimate (GFE) and an initial Truth-in-Lending disclosure – instead of a Loan Estimate. Instead of a Closing Disclosure, you will receive a final Truth in Lending disclosure and a HUD -1 Settlement Statement. If you are applying for a HELOC, a manufactured housing loan that is not secured by real estate, or a loan through certain types of homebuyer assistance programs, you will not receive a GFE or a HUD-1, but you should receive a Truth-in-Lending disclosure.

2003,How much does it cost to receive a Loan Estimate?,,"The Loan Estimate is a new form that goes into effect on October 3, 2015. The only fee a lender can ask you to pay prior to providing a Loan Estimate is a fee for obtaining your credit report. Credit report fees are typically less than $30.A lender cannot collect any other fees before providing you with a Loan Estimate. In fact, a lender must wait until you indicate that you’d like to proceed with the loan application before charging you any other fees. Until that time, a lender also cannot collect your credit card number or require you to provide a check for anything other than a reasonable fee to obtain your credit report.Once you receive a Loan Estimate, it’s up to you to decide whether you want to proceed with that particular lender and that particular loan application. If you have received your Loan Estimate and you tell the lender that you want to proceed, then the lender can charge you additional fees. For example, lenders commonly charge an application fee or an appraisal fee after you decide to proceed with the loan application.Learn how to proceed with a Loan Estimate.

2005,What exactly happens when a mortgage lender checks my credit?,,"The credit check is reported to the credit reporting agencies as an “inquiry.” Inquiries tell other creditors that you are thinking of taking on new debt. An inquiry typically has a small, but negative, impact on your credit score. Inquiries are a necessary part of applying for a mortgage, so you can’t avoid them altogether. But it pays to be smart about them. As a general rule, apply for credit only when you need it. Applying for a credit card, car loan, or other type of loan also results in an inquiry that can lower your score, so try to avoid applying for these other types of credit right before getting a mortgage or during the mortgage process. Learn more about credit scores. You can shop around for a mortgage and it will not hurt your credit. Within a 45-day window, multiple credit checks from mortgage lenders are recorded on your credit report as a single inquiry. This is because other creditors realize that you are only going to buy one home. You can shop around and get multiple preapprovals and official Loan Estimates. The impact on your credit is the same no matter how many lenders you consult, as long as the last credit check is within 45 days of the first credit check. Even if a lender needs to check your credit after the 45-day window is over, shopping around is usually still worth it. The impact of an additional inquiry is small, while shopping around for the best deal can save you a lot of money in the long run. Note: the 45-day rule applies only to credit checks from mortgage lenders or brokers – credit card and other inquiries are processed separately.You can check your own credit with no impact on your score. When you check your own credit – whether you’re getting a credit report or a credit score – it’s handled differently by the credit reporting agencies and does not affect your credit score. If you are applying for a mortgage and haven’t already checked your credit report for errors, do so now. You can get a free copy of your credit report at www.annualcreditreport.com. If you find any errors, get them corrected as soon as possible.",/askcfpb/2005/What-exactly-happens-when-a-mortgage-lender-checks-my-credit.html,APPROVED,Mortgages,Understanding mortgages | Applying for a mortgage,,<Question: 309 What is a credit report?> | <Question: 311 How do I get a copy of my credit report?> | <Question: 313 What should I look for in my credit report?

2007,My appraisal is less than the sale price.  What does that mean for me?,,"First, get a copy of the appraisal. The appraisal is a professional opinion as to the value of the home you want to purchase.  Appraisers have to follow rules in arriving at the value of a property, and lenders are not allowed to interfere with the appraiser’s judgment. The lender is required to send you a copy of the appraisal. If you haven’t received a copy, ask your lender for it.  A good next step is to ask the seller to reduce the price on the home. You can often use the lower appraised value to negotiate a reduction in the sales price of the home. The appraisal is strong evidence that the price was above the market value of the home.  If the seller won’t reduce the price on the home, you may want to cancel the sale. It is very risky to purchase a home for more than the appraised value.  Consider consulting an attorney about your options.  Depending on the terms of your purchase contract, there may be costs associated with cancelling the sale.  However, these costs are likely small compared to buying a home that isn’t worth what you paid for it.",/askcfpb/2007/my-appraisal-is-less-than-the-sale-price-what-does-that-mean-for-me.html,APPROVED,Mortgages,Applying for a mortgage | Closing on a mortgage,,<Question: 167 What is an appraisal?> | <Question: 192 Do I have the right to receive a copy of my home appraisal?>,Owning a Home

2013,When should I start collecting my Social Security retirement benefits?,When you should start collecting Social Security retirement benefits depends on your specific situation.,"You are eligible to claim Social Security retirement benefits without any reduction at what the Social Security Administration calls the full retirement age. For people born after 1942, full retirement age ranges from 66 to 67, depending on the year you were born. This means you can: Claim your benefits after your full retirement age and receive an increased monthly benefit. Your benefit increases with each month that you wait to claim your benefit after reaching full retirement age. At age 70, you get the maximum monthly possible benefit, there is no additional benefit to be gained by waiting to claim after age 70. Claiming after the full retirement age and getting an increased benefit may make sense if you are healthy, want to work longer, and want the highest possible monthly Social Security benefit.   Claim your benefits before your full retirement age and receive a reduced monthly benefit. Your benefit is reduced for each month that you claim your benefit before you reach full retirement age. At age 62, you will get the lowest possible monthly benefit. Claiming before your full retirement age and getting a reduced benefit may make sense if you are in poor health or need the income owing to unemployment or a disability.The amount you receive from Social Security is a one-time choice. Your payment typically doesn’t change during your retirement, other than cost-of-living adjustments. This means that if you claim a reduced benefit, you receive the reduced amount permanently. And this decision applies not only to your own Social Security benefit, but the payments to others who receive benefits based on your work history, like your surviving spouse and dependent children.

2015,Will the age when I claim my Social Security retirement benefits affect how much I get? ,The monthly amount of your Social Security retirement benefits will depend on the age at which you choose to claim your benefits.  The later you claim the more you get each month.,"You are eligible to claim your Social Security retirement benefits without any reduction at what the Social Security Administration calls the full retirement age. For people born after 1942, the full retirement age ranges from 66 to 67, depending on the year you were born.Your benefit increases each month that you wait after your full retirement age, up to age 70. By claiming after your full retirement age, you can permanently increase your monthly benefit by as much as 32 percent. At age 70, you get the maximum possible monthly benefit, there is no additional benefit to be gained by waiting to claim after age 70. Your benefit is reduced for each month that you claim your benefit before your full retirement age. You can claim your benefit as early as age 62, but this reduces your monthly benefit by as much as 30 percent. At age 62, you get the lowest possible monthly benefit. FACT: Monthly payments are 75 percent greater for those who collect at age 70 compared to those who claim early at 62. For example, for someone with an expected monthly benefit of $1,000 at full retirement age, the expected monthly benefit at age 62 is $750 while the expected monthly benefit at age 70 is $1,320.

2017,Do I get more money if I claim my Social Security retirement benefits as soon as possible?,"You get less each month, if you claim your Social Security retirement benefits early.","Whether you will get more or less over your whole lifetime if you claim earlier or later depends largely on your lifespan. Claiming Social Security at age 70 means you get fewer checks, but the size of each monthly check is larger. On the other hand, claiming Social Security earlier means that you get more checks, but the size of each check is smaller. Because of the increased size of your monthly check if you claim after age 62, there is a point at which you break even. For example, if you live to about age 78, you get the same total amount in benefits regardless of whether you claimed at age 62 or at your full retirement age. You break even before age 78 if you claim at age 63 and after if you claim at age 70. There is a good chance that you may live beyond age 78. In fact, on average, a woman reaching age 65 today will live to age 86.6, and a man will live to age 84.3. If you do live beyond this age and claim at your full retirement age, you get a larger monthly check and a larger total amount over your lifetime compared to claiming at 62. Here’s why it could be important for you to have the highest possible Social Security monthly benefit as you age: Social Security usually has an annual cost of living adjustment that ensures that the value of your Social Security benefit keep pace with inflation for as long as you live.    You could spend 20 years or more in retirement, as many people do now. Because Social Security pays a monthly benefit for as long as you live, getting a higher benefit can help you secure your financial situation in your later years as other sources of income and savings are depleted.   Unlike a 401(k) or an IRA, Social Security benefits are paid each month, which means you don’t have to worry about investing or keeping track of the stock market.

2019,Should I claim my Social Security retirement benefits when I stop working?,It's important to research your options for when to claim Social Security.  Claiming your Social Security benefits and leaving the workforce are two separate decisions.,"You don’t have to claim your benefits when you stop working, and you can continue to work even if you claim your benefits.While many people choose to claim their benefits when they stop working, you can time these decisions in a way that’s best for you.When deciding when to stop work and when to claim your benefits, keep in mind:If you claim your benefits before what the Social Security Administration calls the full retirement age, and you continue to work, your benefits are temporarily reduced through the Social Security earnings test if you earn over a specified amount. What many people do not know, however, is that once you reach full retirement age, Social Security recalculates your benefit and credits you for any month that you were affected by the earnings test. This means your Social Security payments are higher after you reach full retirement age.Applying for Medicare is a separate decision. Typically, Medicare benefits are not available until you turn age 65. If you stop working before age 65, and you receive health insurance through your employer, you need to consider how to provide for your health coverage until you are eligible for Medicare. Unlike Social Security, you must apply for Medicare at age 65 or penalties could apply.

2021,How do automatic debit payments from my bank account work?,,"People use automatic payments set up with a merchant or other service provider to pay bills and other recurring payments from their bank or credit union accounts.  This could be for utility bills, credit card bills, monthly fees for childcare, gym fees, car payments, or even a mortgage.  Such automatic payments can be a convenient way for people to make sure they pay their bills on time.  Some lenders offer an interest rate reduction on loans for paying by automatic debit. However, before you give anyone your bank account number and permission to automatically withdraw money from your bank account on a regular basis, it’s good to know how automatic debits work, and what to be careful about.    How do automatic debit payments work?To set up automatic debit payments directly with a company, such as a student loan or mortgage servicer or even a gym, you give the company your checking account or debit card information and give them permission (“authorization”), in advance, to: electronically withdraw money from your account;  on a recurring basis, usually at regular intervals like every month.  You can set up automatic debit payments to pay the same amount each time, or you can allow payments that vary in amount within a specified range - for example, for your utility bill that changes each month.  The company should let you know at least 10 days before a scheduled payment if the payment will be different than the authorized amount or range, or the amount of the most recent payment.   How are automatic debit payments different from bill-pay?Automatic debit payments work differently than the recurring bill-pay feature offered by your bank. In recurring bill-pay, you give permission to your bank or credit union to send the payments to the company. With automatic debits, you give your permission to the company to take the payments from your bank account. Be cautious about giving anyone your bank account information and authorizationAutomatic payments can help you stay on track with bills and other regular payments. However, be careful about giving a company permission to take payments directly from your account. Before you give a company permission to make automatic withdrawals:Verify the company. Before agreeing to let a company automatically take money out of your bank account, make sure the company is legitimate and credible. Consider using a different payment method until you’re sure you’re happy with the company or service. Never give your bank account or debit card information to a company that you’re at all unsure about. Know your rights. A company cannot require you to repay a loan by automatic debit from your checking account as a condition for giving you a loan (unless the loan is an overdraft line of credit). Be wary of a company that pressures you to repay by automatic debit.Be careful about overdraft and insufficient funds (NSF) fees. Automatic payments can help you avoid late fees on your bills.  But if you forget to track your account balance and it’s too low when an automatic (or other) payment is due, you might have to pay overdraft or NSF fees.  Both the bank and the company might charge you a fee if there is not enough in your account.  These fees can add up quickly. Pay close attention to your bank account balance and upcoming automatic payments to make sure there will be enough money in your account when the payment is scheduled. Review the terms of your agreement. The company must give you a copy of the terms of your payment authorization. The payment authorization is your agreement to allow the company to debit your bank account for payment.  The terms of your authorization must be laid out in a clear and understandable way.  It’s important to review the copy of your authorization and keep a copy for your records. Make sure you understand how much and how often money will be taken out of your account.  Monitor your account to make sure the amount and timing of the transfers are what you agreed to.You also have the right to stop automatic payments – click here for information.",/askcfpb/2021/How-do-automatic-debit-payments-from-my-bank-account-work.html,APPROVED,Bank accounts and services,Understanding checking accounts | Direct deposit and electronic fund transfers,,,

You have the right to stop a company from taking automatic payments from your account, even if you previously allowed them.  For example, you may decide to cancel your membership or service with the company, or you might decide to pay a different way. If you decide you want to stop automatic debit payments from your account: Call and write the company. Tell the company that you are taking away your permission for the company to take automatic payments out of your bank account.  This is called “revoking authorization.” Click here for a sample letter.

Click here for a sample letter.  Some banks and credit unions may offer you an online form.Even if you have not revoked your authorization with the company, you can stop an automatic payment from being charged to your account by giving your bank a “stop payment order.” This instructs your bank to stop allowing the company to take payments from your account. Click here for a sample “stop payment order.” Here’s how you can do a stop payment order:a. To stop the next scheduled payment, give your bank the stop payment order at least three business days before the payment is scheduled.  You can give the order in person, over the phone or in writing. b. To stop future payments, you might have to send your bank the stop payment order in writing. If your bank asks for a written order, make sure to provide it within 14 days of your oral notification.  c. Be prepared to include a copy of your revocation to the company (see step 1) with your written stop-payment order. 4. Monitor your accounts. Tell your bank or credit union right away if you see a payment that you did not allow (authorize) or a payment that was made after you revoked authorization. Federal law gives you the right to dispute and get your money back for any unauthorized transfers from your account as long as you tell your bank in time. Click here for a sample letter.Be aware that banks commonly charge a fee for executing a stop payment order.  Further, cancelling your automatic payment does not cancel your contract with the company.  If you want to cancel a contract for a service, like cable or a gym, be sure to cancel your contract with the company as well as telling it to stop automatic payments.  If you cancel an automatic payment on a loan, you still have to make payments on that loan.  If you’re having a problem with a bank account or service or another financial product or service, submit a complaint to the CFPB at consumerfinance.gov/complaint or (855) 411-2372.",/askcfpb/2023/how-do-I-stop-automatic-payments-from-my-bank-account.html,APPROVED,Bank accounts and services,Direct deposit and electronic fund transfers | Money management,,,
2025,"Structured settlements: What should I know before giving up my monthly disability, personal injury or structured settlement payments in exchange for a one-time lump sum payment?",,"Warning: You could receive much less cash than your settlement is worth. Dealing with companies that offer lump sum payments for your disability, personal injury or structured settlement payments can be very risky. Some companies target people with disabilities who have structured settlements. If you receive a flyer or solicitation promising fast cash or a lump sum payment for your monthly payments, be aware! Consider all options, including talking to people you trust with your finances, or your own lawyer or financial counselor, before trading your future payments for instant cash. What is a structured settlement? A structured settlement pays out regular tax-free payments for a specified length of time. A traditional settlement is generally paid out in one payment. A structured settlement protects you from immediately spending your entire settlement at once and assures you receive monthly income for a specified period of years. These structured settlements occur after you have made a personal injury claim and have settled or won your case.Structured settlement payments can contribute to long-term financial stability and help ensure that you have a steady flow of monthly income. Sometimes these payments are called disability payments since you receive money for injuries. However, these structured settlement payments are not Social Security Disability Insurance or Supplemental Security Income payments. Who wants your structured settlement payments? Some companies aggressively market “cash now” deals to people with structured settlements. These companies make money by getting your structured settlement for much less than what the total settlement is worth over time. The companies will want you to give up the entire amount of your structured settlement or a portion.What happens when you give up your structured settlement? Usually, you get one lump sum payment upfront. However, you’re permanently giving up your right to receive your payments under the structured settlement. The lump sum will be much less than you would get in regular payments over time from your structured settlement. The payments you would have received go to the company that took over your structured settlement and you won’t be entitled to any more monthly payments. For example: let’s say you have a structured settlement with all future monthly payments totaling $50,000. The value right now of all of those future payments in today’s dollars is $40,000. If the company offers $15,000 for your structured settlement, you are basically giving the company $25,000 of your money, as well as giving up the assurance of receiving monthly income for a number of years.Why not take a lump sum? It can be a bad deal for you because you may be getting a lot less money than you would get over time. By giving up your structured settlement, you are signing over the right to these guaranteed payments and money that you may need for your monthly expenses for the one-time benefit of receiving a lump sum. Potential risks to taking a lump sum include: spending your lump sum payment quickly and not having money for living expenses later; losing it in an investment; or someone trying to take or borrow the money from you.Monthly payments don’t have those risks. Monthly payments may give you the needed stability to manage your finances, to pay your rent or mortgage, and to pay your bills. Take a hard look at your ability to manage money before you accept one of these deals. Make sure you have a plan in place for how you will pay your monthly expenses without the benefit of monthly payments from your structured settlement. Get answers before you consider giving up your structured settlement payments:Do you have other options? If you are having trouble paying your bills and see a lump sum payment as an opportunity to get out of debt, first contact your creditors to see if you can work something out. If you have hospital bills, check and see if your hospital has a “charity care” program or a way of providing free or reduced prices. What are the costs? Get a written statement with the following information from the company that wants your structured settlement: the total dollar amount of all your remaining monthly payments; the value in today’s dollars of that total dollar amount; the number of payments remaining; how much you would receive as a lump sum;all fees, interest or discount rate, and costs. Tip: Get a second opinion or an independent evaluation from a trusted source, your own attorney, or a financial adviser. Be cautious of recommendations from the company trying to get your structured settlement.What’s the cancellation policy? Depending on your state law, you may have the right to cancel or rescind the agreement within a certain time frame, even after you signed. Get your cancellation rights in writing before you consider signing. Do you have to pay taxes? Your monthly structured settlement payments may be tax-free. Receiving a lump sum payment may have tax implications. Consult a tax advisor before signing.Will there be an impact on public benefits? If you receive public benefits, or plan to in the future, getting a lump sum payment may impact your eligibility. Check with your lawyer, your local legal aid office, or the department that administers those benefits.Do you have rights under your state law? Nearly all states require a judge to approve the agreement to give up a structured settlement. These states may require a judge to decide if the agreement is in your best interest or is necessary, reasonable, or appropriate. Your state law may provide for certain disclosures to be made before you sign. You should think hard about whether this is a good deal for you. Are there complaints about the company?  Check with your state Attorney General’s Office or state consumer protection office . Check and see if the company is licensed to do business in your state. What if I want more help?

2037,I am a servicemember on active duty thinking about refinancing or consolidating my existing debt.  What should I watch out for?,,"First, consider whether your existing debt is covered by the Servicemember’s Civil Relief Act (SCRA).  For servicemembers with loans taken out prior to their entry into military service, the SCRA provides a variety of protections.  For example, under the SCRA, a servicemember who took out a loan before entering the military is entitled to request an interest rate reduction down to 6%.  To request the reduction, a servicemember must provide to their servicer written notice and a copy of their orders to report for active duty.  This interest rate reduction lasts the entire time a servicemember is on active duty.  For Reservists, this benefit starts on the date they received their orders to report for military service.  For all others entering military service, the benefit begins on the date they start military service.If you have a pre-service loan covered by SCRA, refinancing that loan after you enter military service could cause you to lose protections for a variety of types of loans.  You may have different rights and protections depending on what type of pre-service loan you are thinking of refinancing",/askcfpb/2037/I-am-a-servicemember-on-active-duty-thinking-about-refinancing-or-consolidating-my-existing-debt-what-should-I-look-out-for.html,APPROVED,Debt collection,Understanding debt collection | Protections for servicemembers,Servicemembers,<Question: 2039 I am a servicemember on active duty thinking about refinancing my existing mortgage.

2039,I am a servicemember on active duty thinking about refinancing my existing mortgage.  What should I watch out for,,"If you took out your existing mortgage prior to entering military service, the SCRA provides a variety of protections that you could lose if you refinance. When you refinance your mortgage, it is considered a new loan. If you are serving on active duty when you refinance, the new mortgage loan will not be covered under the protections of the SCRA since it is no longer considered a pre-service loan. Prior to refinancing, it is important to consider all the implications of losing your SCRA benefits. The SCRA not only provides an interest rate reduction to 6% during your period of service and for an additional year after you leave active duty, but it also provides protections against foreclosure without a valid court order while you are on active duty, as well as for an additional nine months after leaving active duty.If you still have questions about your SCRA protections, you can contact your Judge Advocate General (JAG).

2045,What happens if I still owe money on the vehicle I want to trade-in?,,"If you still have a loan for the vehicle you plan to trade in, there are steps you should take to carefully consider whether to take on new debt for another vehicle before you have paid off your old vehicle:Find out how much you still owe on your current vehicle. Get the “payoff amount” from your current lender. This is the amount it will take to pay off your existing loan, and it may be different from any outstanding balance listed on your statement or coupon book. This difference may be because of a prepayment penalty or the way interest is calculated;Research your trade-in’s value, so you will know if the amount you still owe on your trade-in is less than it is worth, make sure during any negotiations that you consider whether you are getting fair value for your trade-in and you are able to fully pay off the old auto loan.Decide if you are going to pay off your existing loan now, wait until you pay off your old auto loan before you borrow for another vehicle, or include the amount that you still owe on your current vehicle in your new auto loan;If you owe more on your current vehicle than it is worth and you roll the balance of your existing auto loan into your new auto loan, this could make the new auto loan much more expensive. Your total loan cost will be higher because you will be borrowing more than just the price of your new vehicle. If you decide to roll the balance of your existing auto loan into your new loan:Find out which department of your current lender to contact in order to confirm that, once you have your new loan, your old loan has been paid off.After about a week, use the contact information to find out if your old loan has been paid off.If your loan has not been paid off, contact the lender. If, after reasonable efforts, your loan has still not been paid off, you may want to consider submitting a complaint to the Federal Trade Commission, or with the CFPB online or by calling us toll-free at 1-855-411-CFPB (2372). You can also tell us about your experience without submitting a formal complaint. You can also contact your state attorney general. TIP:Research your trade-in’s value so you know whether the amount you still owe on your trade-in is more or less than it is worth. Then during any negotiations you can decide whether you are getting fair value for your trade-in and whether you are able to fully pay off the old auto loan. If your auto loan payoff amount is more than the dealer is willing to give you for your trade-in then you will still have to pay off what you owe on your old vehicle even if you trade it in. You should consider whether it makes sense to go through with the new purchase, because in this circumstance your new loan will include the amount you still owe from your old vehicle and the amount you are borrowing for your next vehicle. Be very careful to make sure you understand the total cost of the new loan, the monthly payments, and the loan term (in months), before you agree to anything.",/askcfpb/2045/still-owe-money-on-vehicle-i-want-to-trade-in.html,APPROVED,Auto loans,Understanding auto loans,,<Question: 819 What is included in the monthly payment on an auto loan?> | <Question: 837 How do I know who my auto loan lender or servicer is?> | <Question: 849 What should I do if I expect difficulty making my auto loan payments?>,Auto Loan Complaint

2053,What types of fees do prepaid cards typically charge?,"With most prepaid cards, you will have to pay some fees for holding or using the card. The kinds of fees and their amounts vary depending on the card and how you use it. Read your cardholder agreement to understand the fees your card charges.","If you’re considering getting a prepaid card, think about how you will use the card. Then shop around for a prepaid card with fees that work best for the way you plan to use the card.Here are some of the types of fees that prepaid cards may charge. Not all prepaid cards charge all the fees listed or offer all of these services, and some cards may have other fees in addition to the ones listed below or may use different names to describe similar fees. Common fees for prepaid cardsMonthly Fee A monthly fee is a fixed fee you pay each month. You pay this fee even if you don’t use your card. The fee is automatically deducted from your account balance. Some cards that charge a monthly fee may waive the fee under certain circumstances, such as if you arrange to have your pay or social security directly deposited into your prepaid account. Transaction Fee A transaction fee is a fee charged every time you use the card for a certain type of transaction. Your card provider might charge transaction fees under a “pay-as-you-go” plan. Some cards charge you a monthly fee instead of a transaction fee. Other cards let you choose between a plan that charges transaction fees and one that charges a single monthly fee.In-Network / Out-of-Network ATM Fee Individual banks and ATMs belong to different networks. Your prepaid card provider may belong to one or more of these networks. An ATM may be in-network or out-of-network depending on your particular card and which network the ATM belongs to. Depending on the terms of your cardholder agreement, you may pay less or even be able to avoid ATM fees by using your prepaid card at in-network ATMs.Balance Inquiry Fee You may be charged a balance inquiry fee if you check your prepaid card balance at an ATM, or if you call customer service to ask about your balance. Not all prepaid cards charge the same kinds of fees to check your balance. Most cards offer at least one free way to check your balance. For example, you might be able to check your balance online for free or request the balance information by email or text. Check your cardholder agreement to learn about the fees that apply to checking your balance. You may be able to avoid or keep down your fees if you know how to check your balance for free.Cash Reload Fee A cash reload fee is a fee for adding money to your card at a retail location. Generally, the retail location will charge a fee for reloading cash. Most prepaid cards provide other options for loading money to your card, such as direct deposit, without a fee. Direct deposit may save you money.Paper Statement Fee Some prepaid cards charge a fee if you request paper statements for your prepaid card. You may be able to go online to get a statement, or at least a list of your recent card purchases and other transactions, without a fee. Decline Fee A decline fee is a fee charged if you attempt to use your card for something that costs more than the amount of money you have left on your card. Many prepaid cards do not charge decline fees. Inactivity Fee An inactivity fee is a fee charged if you don’t use your card for a certain period of time. The length of time that triggers an inactivity fee varies. Not all prepaid cards charge inactivity fees.Card-to-card transfer fee You may be charged a fee if you transfer money between two prepaid cards. This is called a card-to-card or person-to-person transfer fee. However, some card providers allow you to transfer money between cards online without a fee. Bill payment fee Some prepaid cards let you sign up to pay your bills online through the card provider’s website. Your card provider may charge a fee each time you use the program to pay a bill.If you plan to use your prepaid account to pay bills, compare these fees before you select a card. You may also want to consider whether there are less costly ways to pay your bills, such as paying them through the vendor directly.Card replacement fee Your prepaid card provider may charge a fee to replace your card if it is lost, stolen or damaged.Additional card fee Some prepaid providers let you get an extra card for another person you designate as an “authorized user” of your card. That card lets someone else spend your money, so you want to think carefully about whether to add an authorized user to your prepaid account. You may have to pay a fee for the additional card. Any new authorized users will have to register online or call customer service to verify their identity.Foreign transaction fee A foreign transaction fee, is a fee your card provider charges when you use your prepaid card in a foreign country or to pay in a foreign currency. This fee is usually a percentage of your purchase, withdrawal, or other transaction, rather than a flat fee. This fee is also called a currency conversion fee.Card cancellation fee You can cancel a prepaid card at any time. You usually won’t pay a fee to cancel your card, but there may be a fee to get a check for the remaining balance on the card. To avoid the fee, you can spend or withdraw the remaining funds on your card before you cancel the card.",/askcfpb/2053/what-types-fees-do-prepaid-cards-typically-charge.html,APPROVED,Prepaid cards,Understanding prepaid cards | Fees and charges,,<Question: 379 What is a prepaid card?> | <Question: 433 What is the difference between a prepaid debit card and a credit card?>,Prepaid cards and other prepaid accounts

2069,What’s the difference between a credit report and a credit score?,Your credit reports and your credit scores are two different things. A credit report is a statement that has information about your credit activity and current credit situation such as loan paying history and the status of your credit accounts. Your credit scores are calculated based on the information in your credit report.,"Your credit score, as well as the information on your credit report, are important for determining whether you’ll be able to get a mortgage, credit card, auto loan, or other credit product, and the rate you’ll pay.

2071,What was the National Mortgage Settlement?,,"In February 2012, 49 state attorneys general, the District of Columbia and the federal government entered into the largest consumer financial protection settlement in US history with what were then, the Nation’s five largest mortgage servicers. The agreement settled state and federal claims against Ally/GMAC, Bank of America, Citi, JP Morgan Chase and Wells Fargo that they routinely signed foreclosure related documents without knowing if they were correct, a practice referred to at the time as “Robo-signing.” The settlement provided over $50 billion in relief to distressed borrowers harmed by the wrongful foreclosures and direct payments to the states and the federal government. The settlement included relief to servicemembers who were wrongfully foreclosed upon or charged higher interest rates in violation of the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, or forced to sell their home at loss due to Permanent Change of Station (PSC) orders. Similar settlements were later made with HSBC, Ocwen and Suntrust. The CFPB was a party to these later settlements. The payments owed by servicers to consumers under these settlements were administered by an independent monitor. As of December 31, 2016 the monitor reported that all eligible consumers had received claim checks with the exception of some HSBC customers whose claim checks will be mailed in early 2017.For information about the National Mortgage Settlement, visit www.nationalmortgagesettlement.com.If you’re having trouble paying your mortgage, contact the CFPB at (855) 411-2372 to be connected to HUD-approved housing counselor.
